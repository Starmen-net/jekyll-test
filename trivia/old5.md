    <b>What are the three burger-type items in EarthBound?</b>  The Hamburger, the Double burger, the Mammoth burger.<br />
    <b>Where can the Coin of Silence be found in a present?</b>  First, hand me a SPoD.  Second, I'd like to admit that I was corrected on this question and <i>thought</i> I made the necessary modifications to the question.  I didn't.  I was <i>intending</i> for the Milky Well cave system [which is actually the Coin of Slumber], but the correction stated the gold mine.  I'm taking both as correct due to my forgetfulness in correcting.  Third, hand me another SPoD.  Fourth, give me a third SPoD.<br />
    <b>Where are you warped if you're shocked by Carpainter's lightning?</b>  You are warped to Meagre Livin' Farm.  You are warped nowhere else.  You are not warped anywhere by way of the head-handed-to-you scene, because you'd have to have been killed in battle, but the lightning will be <i>reflected</i> if you're in battle because you'd have the Franklin badge [a pre-requisite to fighting Carpainter].</p>
<p>Of those who entered, CabezaGrande, Devin, Mario, Hawksun and Moochie got 100% this week.</p>
