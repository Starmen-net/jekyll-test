[When I use the word "see" in this question, I refer to both the enemies his monster collection on the third floor of his body and the enemies which you can fight in Dungeon Man.]</b>  Winters.  Fourside only has three enemies appearing in Dungeon Man: the Mystical Record, Musica and Scalding Cup of Coffee.  On the other hand, Winters has at least four doing so: Gruff Goat [monster collection], Mad Duck [monster collection], Worthless Protoplasm [can fight], and Lesser Mook [can fight].<br />

    <p><b>How many <i>houses</i> [thereby ignoring stores and the Library] in Onett fit both of the following criteria: you may get an item from a present box <i>or</i> living creature in the house; the house is connected to a dirt road?</b>  Three.  Ness' house.  The Exit mouse house.  The Minch residence.  You get the Travel charm outside it, and the Hideout isn't attached to a dirt road.  Unless one runs inexplicably through the forest into a dead end where it really has no business being.<br />
    <b>What does the boy, who a woman in Fourside thinks to be a Peeping Tom, believe Magnet Hill may be to you?</b>  It may be your place.<br />

       <p><b>What character is the more proficient haiku writer, Everdred or a composite of all the Tessie-watchers?</b> A composite of the Tessie-watchers.  Everdred cited one haiku; I can think of two cited by Tessie-watchers.<br />
        <b>In terms of the number of Greek letters that he learns, who learns the most attack PSI?</b> Paula.  Please note that I may, in the future, trick you with similar gender-non-specifications.<br />
        <b>What Greek letter is <i>sometimes</i> substituted for gamma in some shield PSI?</b> Sigma.  If you would like to dispute this with me, and claim it's actually epsilon, please look in a dictionary for transcriptions of the letters of the Greek alphabet.  (Preferred dictionary: a thick one, perhaps the size of two average-sized textbooks.)<br />
        <b>Of the PSI families labelled as "Attack" PSI in the Status menu and during battle that <i>both</i> Paula and Poo learn [meaning they both learn at least one PSI-level in that family], in which one does Poo learn the greater number of levels?</b>  This would be PSI Thunder.<br />
    <b>Who does Mr. Polestar consider to be the prime suspect in the kidnapping of his daughter?</b>  Mr. Everdred. </p>

<p>        <b>Aside from being able to poison you, what action &#0151; also used by the other enemy most-genetically-close to the Deadly Mouse &#0151; which the Deadly Mouse can take may be responsible for it being called "Deadly"?</b> SMAAAASH attacks.<br />
        <b>Other than the Onett Arcade, in what other arcade can you find an actual arcade game?</b> The Fourside Department Store.<br />
        <b>Who wonders who the cool one is as your battle against him slows to a crawl?</b> Pokey.<br />
        <b>Against which of the hero characters would equipping the Sea pendant be most effective, when what PSI it weakens, stunts or otherwise defeats are taken into consideration?  Why?</b>  Paula.  Using a [NPaPo] triplevalue system which indicates how many PSI families or letters [see question five] each uses, and which the Sea pendant defends against, we see: Fire Alpha through Omega are defended against [040], Freeze Alpha through Omega defended against [083], and Flash Alpha through Omega are defended against [483].  But if we go by the families, we get [121].  In either case, Paula is still ahead.<br />
    <b>Again, referring to what PSI it defends against, against which hero character, to which it <i>is</i> effective, is the Star Pendant least effective?  Why?</b>  Remembering that it has to be effective <i>against</i> the person, that leaves Poo; this is because Jeff does not use PSI and therefore the Star Pendant <i>cannot be</i> effective against him.  It defeats Fire [040], Freeze [083], Flash [483] and Paralysis [683]  Poo has the lowest value.  Even if you go by families [Fire, Flash] rather than letters [&alpha; &beta;] and other such stuff, it still ends up with Poo having the least powers [221] defeated by the pendant.</p>

<p>Deadly Pudding and Paralistalon won this week.  This week appears to be the end of the series of weeks with a number of winners klutzes in shop classes could count on a single hand.</p>

<p>     <b>In Winters, how many telephones are located north of Lake Tess?</b> Two.  One's in the drugstore Best Friend; the other is in the phone tent at Fort Tessiewatcher.<br />
        <b> How many police force members confirmably of the rank "Captain" do you fight in Onett?</b> One.  Captain Strong.<br />
        <b>What video game is mentioned most often in EarthBound?</b> EarthBound.  It's mentioned at least three times in Onett and scores an additional mention in Dungeon Man.  EarthBound 2 comes up close, with two mentions at most.<br />
        <b>What are the given names of the Dusty Dunes miners?</b>  George and Gerardo.<br />
    <b>From where does one of the Runaway Five claim that a nipper has taken them?</b>  He claims that the nipper has taken them from a nightmare.  Kudos if you included "to a dream" in your answer.</p>

<p>    <b>What kind of law enforcement does the woman in the Onett police station want to go into?</b> Parking metre enforcement, metre-maiding, etc.<br />
        <b>If you want to join the Sharks, you have to come back after doing something.  What is that something?</b>  You have to beat EarthBound.  Isn't that just ironic?<br />
        <b>Other than Master Belch, what is the name of the other enemy that you could talk to in Belch Base?</b> The Slimy Little Pile.  Not the Slimy Little Pig.<br />
        <b>Outside which building do you first encounter Pokey <i>outside of</i> Onett?</b> The mountain cabin, in Peaceful Rest Valley, where Paula is imprisoned.<br />

        <b>Where is it claimed that espresso stunts growth?</b>  Newsflash!  "Patron of Jackie's Café claims, 'Espresso stunts growth, Stubby!'"<br />
        <b>What does a character in post-blue Happy Happy Village decide wasn't such a good idea after all?</b> The character in question is the formerly-blue cattle [is cattle the proper gender-non-specific noun since we can't tell if it's female or male?].  What he/she has decided wasn't such a good idea after all was ... *dramatic pause* ... a blue cow.<br />
