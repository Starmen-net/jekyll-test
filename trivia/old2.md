<p><b>Where can Penetella Giovanni be found?</b> The second floor (2F) of the Fourside Bakery.<br />
<b>What IS the Pharaoh's Curse, according to its information?</b>  Honestly, I don't know what some people read this question as.  Some people told me what it is; others told me what it does; someone even told me <i>where it is</i>...  The Pharaoh's Curse is an ectoplasmic ooze (that may poison the enemy) being disgorged out of the dreadful box.<br />
<b>What does someone in the restaurant order before they realise you're not the waiter?</b>  The Braised Boa over Minced Baby Leeks.<br />
<b>Whom does the Fourside tabloid say was found to have been in the House of Representatives?</b>  Lucky of the Runaway Five.<br />
<b>What is the profit made by buying a Fresh Egg in Twoson and selling the Chicken it eventually becomes?</b>  $98.  If you'd like to challenge my ruling on this, look at it this way: you buy the Fresh Egg for $12.  Then you sell the Chicken it becomes for $110.  110 minus 12 is 98.</p>
<p>Falcon24, CodeHunter64, BlueAntoid and Emperor Jade were the only people to answer all five questions correctly this week.</p>

<b>To what organisation does the person warning kids to play no longer than two hours belong?</b>  Parents Opposing Obsession Plan.  I don't think there was a similar acronym in Mother 2, though...<br />
<b>What's so special about the black telephone in the Hotel Darkmoon?</b>  It's incessantly ringing until, of course, you pick up the receiver.<br />
<b>What can Ness lose all of <i>only</i> when he's homesick?</b>  Motivation in battle.<br />

<p>    <b>What is the name of the only body of water in Magicant?</b>  The Sea of Eden.<br />
    <b>What five Greek letters are used in designating the increasing power in PSI powers?</b> Alpha, beta, gamma, omega, sigma.<br />
    <b>What is the first enemy to share an outside sprite with Arachnid! and Arachnid!!!?</b>  Gigantic Ant.  In fact, I think it's the <i>only</i> other enemy with the spider outside sprite.  (Note: it has been brought to my attention that the Ant has its own sprite; and the Roaches share the Arachnid sprite.  As a result, I am running through the trivia answers and determining just <i>who</i> answered Violent Roach (that being the first to share the sprite).  I would also like to point out that, I suppose, my question was not defined clearly enough: it was not intended to be answered using PK Hack: I intended for you to use what you could see, based on the background.  That's where I was thinking Gigantic Ant.)<br />
    <b>Which EarthBound town/city/etc.'s tabloid refers to a giant rat in the sewers?</b>  Summers' does.  Not Fourside's, which is what one might think.<br />
    <b>Which Sanchez brother is the eldest?</b>  Pancho.  Tomas Jefferson is <i>not</i> a Sanchez.</p>
<p>BlueAntoid and CodeHunter 64 were the only ones to get five of five. </p>
