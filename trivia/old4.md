<p>    <b>What is the Mobile Sprout's way of "calling" for help?</b>  Sowing seeds.<br />
    <b>What two animals are depicted on statues [not necessarily permanent statues, mind you] in Dalaam?</b> The rabbit and the elephant.  Two elephants is technically correct; however, the wording of the question would lead you to consider statutes that didn't necessarily stay.<br />
    <b>Who says that the dream you'll have will be a dream within a dream?</b>  The Hotelier in Magicant.<br />
    <b>What are two of the three items you can receive from the Deep Darkness Tenda, excepting the Tenda who runs the store?</b>  The three items are the Bag of Dragonite [after you give the Shyness book to the Tenda chief], the Tendakraut [once you give him the Shyness book], and the Shyness book.  Any combination of the three are correct.  The Death Ray you get in the Tenda Village, but it isn't given to you.<br />
    <b>What caused the traffic jam in Dusty Dunes Desert?</b> Buffalo.</p><p>
    Those who got 100% on the questions this week were Ness Snorlax, Shivn Dragon, and SimonBob. </p>

<p>    <b>How many ghosts [or Zombie Processors] are there in the Two-Three Tunnel before Belch and the Trillionage Sprout are defeated?</b>  Ugh.  A question that can be multiply interpreted.  There are only four real ghost sprites; however, since you're not supposed to go faster than the ghosts, the game is programmed to bring two ghost sprites in, with no animation, from the side you were walking in on.  Therefore, 4 or 6 is acceptable.<br />
    <b>What does Buzz Buzz say will shatter the nightmare rock?</b> The passing of time.<br />
    <b>Where is the Jersey Turnpike mentioned in EarthBound?</b>  I'll give you a quote.  If you can't figure it out from that, I'll tell you.  Quote: "This baby is a demon child!"  Location: the magazine in the rundown Beak Point House<br />
    <b>Why should you treat the flowers in the garden in Onett nicely?</b> They're representative of the ones in your heart.<br />
    <b>What will Pokey say if you refuse to go with him at the game's beginning?</b>  Something that'll cut you with a knife, then he'll rescind that; then he'll rescind <i>that</i>; and he'll then rescind that.</p>
<p>If you were Daveman Deluxe, Falcon24, Seifer or ShivnDragon, you aced these questions. </p>

<p>    <b>What item do the traveling entertainers give you?</b>  The Travel charm.<br />

    <b>In what building in EarthBound is the book "Our Convenient Society" mentioned?</b>  This is one of those questions you expect everyone to get right.  Let's see.  I've specified I want the building where something is mentioned, and I've defined that something as a book called "Our Convenient Society" -- does anyone think that I'm being sarcastic and should just say the library?<br />

<p>    <b>What kind of smiles does Pokey give when he's a member of your party?</b>  Insincere.<br />
    <b>Which two EarthBound characters stole the Mani Mani statue?  [And yes, it was <i>two</i> separate people at two separate times?]</b> Everdred nabbed it from Carpainter, and Monotoli nabbed it from Everdred.<br />
    <b>What are two of the three items that cause Ness [and other members of the party, depending on the situation] to move faster than they normally do?</b>  The Skip sandwich and Skip sandwich DX are the obvious choices.

    <b>Where was the deal with the evil entity made, according to a Foursidian?</b>  Okay, this was a faulty quote again... I think it was "...where the deal ... took place", but at any rate, it was Jackie's Café.  Or Fourside...</p>
