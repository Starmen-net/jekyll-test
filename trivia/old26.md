<p><b>Question 2:</b> What is the cheapest way to acquire a single diamond band, and where can it be found?</p>
<p><b>Question 3:</b> What is the cheapest way to acquire a single bicycle, and where can it be found?</p>

<p><b>Answer 1:</b> Self-service <b>stand</b> in Happy-Happy Village, for free. (Also accepted: the <b>monkey</b> in the Monkey Caves, a <b>Mad Duck</b> (8/128 chance per combat), and the <b>Chicken</b> by the Hot Springs west of Club Titiboo (Mother 3).)</p>

<p><b>Question 1:</b> How many claymen must you recharge before calling it quits for a day?</p>
<p><b>Question 2:</b> Why in the world would anyone want a DCMC pamphlet?  You're almost certain to have a weapon with higher offense by this point.  (Give a little detail in your explanation, a four-word answer here probably won't get credit.)</p>
<p><b>Question 3:</b> Hey, I see some presents back behind that fence in the train's tunnel.  Can you ever get those?  How?</p>

<p><b>Answer 1:</b> Three claymen, throughout the factory.</p>
<p><b>Answer 2:</b> The big ol' trooper is weak against DCMC merchandise!  You can essentially stun him for a few rounds, making the fight much easier.</p>
<p><b>Answer 3:</b> There was a bit of confusion here, so there are two acceptable answers.  I originally referred to <a href="http://walkthrough.starmen.net/mother3/image/screens/13/fence.png">these presents</a>, which can be found in <b>Chapter 7</b>.  However, I can understand how the question could be mistaken for <a href="http://walkthrough.starmen.net/mother3/image/screens/10/candrumcave.png">these presents</a>, which can be grabbed by Salsa in <b>Chapter 3</b>.  Either answer was acceptable.</p>

<p>Theme: "Lucky!"</p>

<p><b>Question 1:</b> The Casey Bat is a fun weapon, with extremely high offense but an unfortunate miss rate.  How often will one actually hit with the bat in combat?  (<i>Bonus</i>: What is the origin of this miss rate?)</p>

<p><b>Question 2:</b>  Many people are aware of the Sword of Kings and its existence (as well as its rarity).  What exactly are the chances of getting the Sword in a single fight with a Starman Super?  (<i>Bonus</i>: What would the chances of getting two Sword of Kings in consecutive battles with Starman Supers come out to be?)  </p>

<p><b>Question 3:</b> So, I'm in a bad way while fighting Diamond Dog.  Ness is the only character still standing and not K.O'd or diamondized.  His HP is rolling down to 0, and his PP is only 3, so it's time to bust out the only usable item left in my inventory, the lucky sandwich.  How likely is it that this lonely little sandwich will save the day, restoring both my HP and PP to max?  (<i>Bonus</i>: If I were to savescum [ex: reset the game and try again], will I get a different result with the sandwich?  When is this decided?)</p>

<p><b>Question 2:</b>  An iconic figure of the series, where can you encounter the first of the Starmen? (chronologically speaking)</p>
<p><b>Question 3:</b>  These'll make awkward situations between foes and yourself in combat... and not a whole lot else.  You can use it as many times as you'd like; they may even form a theme of sorts later.</p><br />

<p><b>Answer 1:</b> He's hiding in a trash can, at the Twinkle Elementary School.</p>
<p><b>Answer 2:</b> Podunk Zoo presents the first Starman Jr., though regular Starmen can also be found in Spookane and the Yucca Desert.</p>
<p><b>Answer 3:</b> Words o' Love</p>

<p><b>Question 3</b>: This purple perpetrator is much nastier than his relatives, capable of using offensive, support, and healing PSI.  Watch out for him if you're searching for Question 2!</p>

<p><b>Answer 3:</b> Manly Fish's Brother</p>
