<p>Whoo.  Not only did I put off updating until the site shift was over, I even managed to upload the wrong file to the new system.  And got sideswiped by a computer crash.  These questions will look like ones you thought were the right ones.  Mea culpa.</p>

<b>What can homesickness make you hunger for?</b> Your favourite food.<br />

<b>What two types of enemy could theoretically kill you even if you get the first attack and beat them on it?</b> Well, there are three: Oak enemies, Reactor Robot enemies, and Sphere enemies. They can all explode and take you with them.<br />
<b>What food item do you find most often in garbage cans, presents, or other treasure boxes?</b> Cookies and Hamburgers. What is this, Macdonaldland?<br /><br />
