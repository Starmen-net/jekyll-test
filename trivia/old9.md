<p>    <b>What is the more lasting punishment that Aloysius Minch gave Pokey after he chased Pokey and Picky upstairs?  [Hint: it isn't physical.]</b>  Aloysius' more lasting punishment is to ban Pokey from dessert for the rest of the decade.<br />
        <b>Who is the only female character that follows you around who will do <i>nothing</i> to help you in battle?</b>  The woman in northwestern Happy Happy Village who is soliciting donations to rid the world of contaminants.  If you donate, she'll give you a Picture postcard [see question four].  If you refuse to donate, she'll "be your shadow".  (Please note that Pokey 1: is male; and 2: has not been known to scream like a girl outside fanfiction.)<br />
        <b>Five seconds before you enter the room without doors for the first time, how many characters will be in that room?</b> Two.  The golden-toothed man with connected eyebrows and the gruff man who somehow sends you out.<br />
        <b>What is the first place you enter in EarthBound where you can exchange an amount of money for a Picture postcard?</b>  This would be Happy Happy Village.  See question two.<br />
    <b>How many stores are located on the two islands of Scaraba but are not located inside Scaraba city limits?</b>  The answer I was looking for here was two [the water vendor and the store on the southern island, beside the pyramid].  However, if you consider hints commodities, 3 is also acceptable. </p>

<p>    <b>Where does someone insist that they're not a billboard?</b>  Either Summers or Toto; it's arguable whether the man is on, west of, or east of the Invisible Line that divides Summers and Toto.<br />
        <b> Whose name does Lardna Minch appear to invoke [since the name wasn't capitalised] if you talk to her after defeating Starman Junior but <i>before</i> talking to Aloysius Minch?</b>  She appears to invoke the name of Sam Hill.  However, since it wasn't capitalised, it is assumably not an actual invocation of "Sam Hill" but rather one of "sam hill".<br />
        <b>How badly did someone lose at solitaire?</b>  He lost so badly that he lost his shirt.<br />
        <b>Which of Jeff's weapons is considered to be weird junk?</b>  The Death ray.  The garbage dump in the Tenda Village has a sign in it reading "Weird junk."  You find the Death ray in that garbage dump.  Therefore, the Death ray is considered to be weird junk by the Tenda.<br />
    <b>Occasionally, when one levels up, one receives various quotes, such as "Sweet!" and "Oh, baby!".  In which town/city/[insert term of your preference here] can you see the most level-up quotes?</b>  Threed.  I noticed a number of people answering "Magicant".  However, answer me this: what happens if you beat Magicant at level 99?  Will you get those level-up quotes? </p>

<p>CPTCrunch and Daveman Deluxe were this week's winners.</p>

<p>    <b>What item is wielded in battle by the other enemy that you fight in your only <i>necessary</i> battle with a Spiteful Crow?</b>  This is a higher-level question.  Your one necessary battle with a Spiteful Crow is in Peaceful Rest Valley.  You have this battle after you receive the Franklin badge from Paula.  That means that Pokey sent these enemies against you.  It's an Insane Cultist which joins the Spiteful Crow, and he wields a paintbrush.<br />
        <b>Which branch of the United States legislature is mentioned in EarthBound tabloids?</b>  This would be the State House of Representatives.  What State House, I have no idea.  Probably the EB equivalent of New York.<br />
        <b>Who is the first character you meet to mention the Apple of Enlightenment?</b>  Pokey.  Now, he isn't the first person who mentions it, but he is the first person who mentions the Apple of Enlightenment that you meet.  "Starman Deluxe" was the popular response, although wrong; he's the first character to mention it, but not the first mentioner that you meet.<br />
        <b>What allegedly fly away if you make contact with a Magic butterfly?</b>  All your cares.  A man in the Onett library even says so himself...<br />
    <b>Where do the Runaway Five hear Paula's prayer?</b>  Summers. </p>

<p>Only FalconPain won this week.</p>

<p>    <b>How many times during the course of the game is Ness woken from slumber in his own bed?</b>  Note: this was not a trick question.  He's awakened thrice: once by the meteorite, once by Pokey knocking, and once by Picky knocking.<br />
        <b>How long does Ness see the vision he sees at Magnet Hill?</b>  Ness saw a baby's bottle there, but just for an instant.<br />
        <b>Which hero or heroine is the only one who is not named in a newspaper headline?</b>  Jeff.  Poo is mentioned in most newspapers in an intimation that he's "visiting there secretly".  Ness is named in early-Twoson newspapers, not to mention one a little later on in a city I can't exactly remember.  And Paula's name is mentioned in a headline regarding her kidnapping.<br />
        <b>How many Show tickets <i>must</i> you buy at the Topolla Theatre in order to free the Runaway Five from their contract there?</b>  Two.  First you need one in order to talk with Miss Fake and turn on the "flag" which says that the Guardian Diggers have infested the Dusty Dunes Gold Mine.  Then you need another one in order to talk with Miss Fake and give her the Diamond, which frees the Runaway Five.<br />
    <b>Specifically, what kind of beverage does the Scalding Coffee Cup attack you with?</b>  Scalding hot e<i>s</i>presso. </p>

<p>Bill, Blue Stone, Captain Spam, Daveman Deluxe, EBisumaru and FalconPain won this week.</p>

<p>    <b>Why has King decided that he would just lay still for now?</b>  Accursed fleas!  Why must ye suck King dry?<br />
        <b>After Carpainter is defeated, what happens to a man in Happy Happy Village?  Please note that, for the man in question, Happy Happyism made his marriage a very, very happy one.</b>  His wife left him again.  He's so lucky.  (Seriously, no one should have gotten this wrong.  Maybe my <i>blatant hint</i> wasn't blatant enough.)<br />
        <b>What did a couple, who live in Twoson, want to bring, from Happy Happy Village, to their son, still in Twoson?</b>  Some happiness.<br />
        <b>What two things can you do at <i>any</i> Phase Distorter that you have previously used successfully?</b> Communicate with your father and repair biological functions.<br />
    <b>Excluding any PSI that a character knows when you first begin controlling them, what are the two PSI families that must be <i>taught</i> at at least one level as opposed to being realised at all levels?</b>  These would be Starstorm [Poo must be taught both Alpha and Omega] and Teleport [Ness must be taught Alpha]. </p>

<p>    <b>How many monkeys <i>confirmably</i> know how to teleport by the time Giygas is defeated?  By "confirmably" I mean "shown teleporting during the game".</b>  Two to three.  One is the monkey who teaches you to teleport, and another is the monkey you teach to teleport.  The third is the monkey who you meet outside Jackie's Caf√©, assuming he isn't the first monkey I mentioned.<br />
        <b>From whom do you receive Trout yogurt?</b>  You receive Trout yogurt from Electra, Pokey's maid.  I asked for the yogurt, not the dispenser, people.<br />
        <b>As Jeff, when you acquire the Bubble Monkey in Winters, you spend some money.  What do you buy with that money?</b>  You buy bubble gum.  The woman who sells you the gum even says that "you can have the monkey for free" if you purchase the bubble gum.  So you never actually pay for the Bubble Monkey.<br />
        <b>What phrase is found on the signboard specifically advertising the Threed Hint Shop?  The full phrase, please.</b> "Hint Shop Realization".  The bit about horses saying "neigh" but the Hint Shop saying "yea" is found on a signboard advertising the whole of the Eagleland Hint Union.<br />
    <b>What does the man in the Twoson Hotel tell you to get with the 50 dollars he gives you?</b>  A juice or something. </p>

<p>    <b>Brick Road suggests to Jeff that they should meet again once he has done something.  What is that something?</b>  Once he becomes dungeon man.<br />
        <b>What are the non-boss enemies in the Pink Cloud cave system who can harness electricity- or thunder-related powers?  That is, which non-boss enemies in that area might attack with thunder-based attacks?</b>  The Conducting Menace and the Thunder Mite.<br />
        <b>Who gives life to the zombies?</b>  Ignore the fact that this swapped with last week's number 3.  Belch.<br />
        <b>What do <i>you</i> trade for items at a Tendan trading post?</b> The Horn of life.<br />
    <b>What do the <i>characters</i> read when you [as the player] check signboards which read "DON'T ENTER" from the player's perspective?</b> "Do Not Enter". </p>

<p>    <b>What's so special about the phone in L'Hotel du Summers?</b>  It's a green payphone.  All other telephones in hotels are black free telephones.<br />
        <b>How many times before Paula is kidnapped for the second time are the Montague brothers actually shown using their yellow construction machine?  [I have no idea what it's called.]</b>  Once.  That's when the one who was never shown in the mine, Gerardo I believe, gives you the Diamond.<br />
        <b>What is the number [first, second, etc., made] of the first Phase Distorter that you successfully use?</b>  Second.<br />
        <b>How many human citizens of Onett can you speak to between first trying a Phase Distorter and killing Giygas?</b> Three to four: your mother, Tracy, Pokey and possibly your father.
    <b>What is the last Your Sanctuary spot, guarded by an animalian boss whose name implies that he or she is significantly larger than the average member of his or her species, that you visit?</b>  Giant Step.  Shrooom!!! is a fungus, not an animal; Trillionage Sprout is a plant; Carbon Dog and Diamond Dog, Thunder & Storm, Electro Specter and Plague Rat of Doom have no size-suggesting adjective; and various Internet dictionaries disagree as to whether or not "mondo" is a word.  (M-W.com says it isn't, dictionary.com says it is.) </p>

<p>    <b>What are two Your Sanctuary locations that contain <i>no enemies</i> capable of using PSI, with the possible exception of the guardian of that particular location?</b>  Lilliput Step and Magnet Hill.  Giant Step has the Black Antoid and the Attack Slug, Milky Well has the Ranboob, Rainy Circle has the Attack Slug, Pink Cloud has the Conducting Menace, Lumine Hall has the Conducting Spirit, and Fire Spring has the Psychic Psycho.<br />
        <b>In what two locations can you purchase items associated with five little animals that "went to market", "stayed home" and "had roast beef", among other things?</b>  The little animals were piggies.  Saturn Valley and Scaraba.<br />
        <b>Outside of battle, which enemy most resembles Maxwell Labs?</b>  I'd just like to say this: this enemy's name is so euphonic, I sometimes feel you could write music that .<br />
        <b>What food item was developed thanks to the royalty of Summers?</b> The Pasta di Summers.<br />
    <b>On what other floor of the Monotoli Building can one find Geldegarde Monotoli</b>  Either the 48th or the main/ground/first floor. </p>

<p>    <b>What are two of the kinds of seats that are sold out at the Chaos Theatre?</b>  Orchestra, "standing room only" / floor and balcony.<br />
        <b>Ignoring Pokey, who is the only other character (who is on "your side" during a battle) who appears on the enemy's side of the battle screen?</b>  Ness: he appears in a faceshot during the battle against Giygas.<br />
        <b>There is a Your Sanctuary location which, when you first enter the population centre nearest it, you cannot enter (both the dungeon leading up to the actual melody point and the melody point itself).  In order to enter the location in question, you must travel through another Your Sanctuary location (one which you have already seen in this game) and defeat the boss there; acquiring the melody of the location which was just mentioned is not necessary and is technically avoidable.  Name the location that was first mentioned in this question.</b>  Pink Cloud.  You need to get the Carrot key at the end of the Magnet Hill dungeon to enter it.<br />
        <b>What item is being sold by someone who looks like one of the Sanchez brothers?  (Or perhaps like Tomas Jefferson.)</b> Gelato de resort.<br />
    <b>What are the two Your Sanctuary locations for which the Franklin Badge will be <i>effective</i> during the battles against the bosses there?</b> These would be Pink Cloud (Thunder and Storm use Crashing Boom Bang attacks) and Electro Specter (I won't even bother with this one). </p>
