<p>    <b>How many persons are in the circus tent when the zombies are all stuck to the Zombie paper?</b>  Now the answer I was looking for was two, for the shades dude and the business suit.  But people kept answering 5, and I was completely flabbergasted.  "How are they getting 5?"  Then I thought about it a second: Ness, Paula and Jeff.  So 2 and 5 are both acceptable answers.<br />
    <b>What's the first enemy you fight that can leave behind a condiment?</b> The Ramblin' Evil Mushroom.<br />
    <b>What <i>is</i> the condiment mentioned above?</b>  Ketchup packet.<br />
    <b>What's one of the enemies in the Pink Cloud cave against which the Franklin badge is utterly useless?</b>  The Franklin badge, as we all know, reflects lightning-elemental attacks.  The only two enemies in the Pink Cloud cave that have no lightning-based attacks, and thus can't be countered with the Franklin badge, are the Tangoo and the Kiss of Death.  (Note that the <i>French</i> Kiss of Death is an entirely different enemy.)<br />

<p>
Clanker, EBsessor, King Banana, Lucid Faia, psychic ness and Trae Graves won this set.</p>
