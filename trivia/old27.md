<p>Theme: "<b>A Sampling of Samples</b>"!  This week, take a moment to listen to these fairly short clips.  Your job is to identify either a sample used in the song if given a Mother theme, or identify the Mother theme if given a sample.  Due to the somewhat subjective nature of these questions, <b>you only need to answer 5 of the 6 answers correctly</b> in order to get credit this week.  Maybe you can find a novel connection between songs as well!  (These questions can and will draw from more than one of the games in the series!)</p>

<p>To clarify, I expect your answer to either be the name of a song that contains a sample used in the Mother theme; or, the answer should either name the Mother theme or describe where the theme plays in-game in order to get credit for your answer.  For example, if given <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUImpeQG66U&t=0m4s">this</a> theme, my answer would be either the "<a href="http://starmen.net/mother2/music/115-%20Earthbound%20-%20Megaton%20Walk.mp3">Megaton Walk"</a> or the theme that plays when Dungeon Man is following the party.</p>

<p><b>Question 6:</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Dd0EaEbqg">Liberty Bell March</a> (The opening bit.)</p>

<p>Theme: "<b>Danger Zone</b>"</p>

<p><b>Question 1:</b> I don't have a lot to say about this... I guess some people think it's good.  It'll heal you as well.</p>
<p><b>Question 2:</b> A few weeks ago, we mentioned in passing that the Lucky Sandwich is capable of providing a full heal (completely restoring HP).  What other item can do this for you?</p>
<p><b>Question 3:</b> Here's a hypothetical for you this week.  Your party is exhausted from the swamps of Deep Darkness, and wind up in a fight with a Zap Eel and a Hard Crocodile.  Ness is damaged by the crocodile's tail, Paula swings her frying pan to damage the crocodile, while Jeff unloads with bottle rockets to finish off the croc.  The Zap Eel then uses his electrical shock attack, hitting both Ness and Jeff once, knocking both of them unconscious.  Paula is the only remaining party member, and with a paltry 30 HP and 3 PP remaining.  Being a real (wo)man, she refuses to run from the fight.  She has no consumables in her inventory, though she does have some other belongings.<br /> <br />

Using this information, what would be the best strategy for Paula to win the fight and why?  (You may (and should) make logical assumptions; if you do so, please explain these briefly.)</p>

<p><b>Answer 1:</b> Plain Roll (it's the description nearly word-for-word)</p>
<p><b>Answer 2:</b> Kraken Soup (fully restores your HP -- note that I did accept a few others such as Poo eating a Brain Food Lunch)</p>
<p><b>Answer 3:</b> Paula is free to do just about anything because if Ness and Jeff were both killed by lightning-based attacks, it's safe to assume that Paula possesses the <b>Franklin Badge</b>.  (Praying could revive your party and the crocodile, which would probably still result in your victory but is not 100% assured, as bashing or just defending would be.)</p>

<p>Theme: "<b>Means of Conveyance</b>"!</p>

<p><b>Question 1:</b> Hop on here and listen to some rockin' music!  Additionally, how much is the fare for the 4 of you to ride from Fourside to the last stop?</p>
<p><b>Question 2:</b> A certain vehicle is located in the Deep Darkness swamps.  What is it, and why don't you make great use of it?</p>
<p><b>Question 3:</b> These are more prone to attacking you than actually being used for getting around.  Can be seen in cities as well as one peculiar place.</p>

<p><b>Answer 1:</b> <b>$8</b> to ride the <b>bus</b> from Fourside to Twoson.</p>
<p><b>Answer 2:</b> The <b>helicopter</b> can be found in the swamp, but curiously it's missing its <b>engine</b>.</p>
