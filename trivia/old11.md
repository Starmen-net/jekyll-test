<p>    <b>When you first enter the Sea of Eden, how many Kraken are swimming around in the water?</b>  You find three Kraken.  And apparently the Gutsy bat debate has confused an entrant or two; one claimed that Bionic Kraken infest these waters in Ness' mind, not regular Kraken.<br />
        <b>What enemies in the gold mine can poison you?</b>  It's interesting that last week's second answer was the Coil Snake, for one of this week's second answers is the <i>Thirsty</i> Coil Snake.  The other is the Gigantic Ant.<br />

<p>    <b>When a Teddy bear is destroyed, what does it become?</b>  200 HP of damage to the Teddy bear!  The Teddy bear became a useless <i>pile of fluff</i>...  (Emphasis mine)<br />

        <b>What out-of-battle, non-Unconscious status affliction (meaning if you get it, it doesn't magically [psychically?] heal itself at the end of the battle) can a Mook-named enemy (one with "Mook" in its name) inflict on you?</b>  Diamondisation.<br />
        <b>How does one get the Monkey's love?</b>  First, let me express my thankful astonishment no one gave an EASY-Trivia-esque answer such as "by being nice to a monkey".  Secondly, you obtain it by ... being nice enough to a monkey to teach it how to teleport.<br />

        <b>What can the Toothbrush do to the opposing side of a battle when someone uses it?</b>  It causes the body of one member of the opposing side to solidify.<br />
        <b>Before you take the Sky Runner for the first time, why is a Mad Duck making something spin around so ineffective?</b>  Something spinning around causes a loss in PP, but Jeff has no PP, and before you take the Sky Runner for the first time, he's the only character who can fight a Mad Duck.<br />

<p>    <b>What does the girl in the Chaos Theatre pose as so that she isn't stopped by security if she tries to go backstage?</b>  She poses as your sister.<br />
        <b>Who gave said girl permission to go backstage?</b>  Ultimately, Lucky of the Runaway Five told the girl she could go backstage, but you had to allow her to pose as her sister.  By the way, can someone please tell me just where my grammar was off in this question and in the previous one?  The only place I see a possible grammatical error is the fact I ended a clause with a *dramatic pause* preposition.  I'll give you candy if you can find the error.<br />
        <b>What are three locales where secret arms vendors sell you goods?</b>  Threed, Dusty Dunes and Fourside all carry secret arms vendors.  You can also find a SAV in Scaraba and Deep Darkness.<br />
        <b>With what other enemy can the Runaway Dog appear in battles in Twoson?</b>  The Crooked Cop.  Okay, hands up: who saw question five and thought I was being sneaky, hiding the answer in another question?  You fools, the Over Zealous Cop only appears in Summers!  (Apologies to any non-fools who I may have offended with that line.)<br />
    <b>What sort of hold can the Over Zealous Cop use on you?</b>  Submission holds. </p>

<p>    <b>What do Bookas shriek?</b>  The Crested Booka shrieked a war cry!<br />
        <b>Sometimes when Ness calls his mom, his mother says that she covered for him.  Who had just come by the house?</b>  Ness' teacher had just visited.<br />
        <b>When Jeff first meets his father in the game, what does his father ask him if he wants?</b>  Dr. Andonuts asks Jeff if he wants a doughnut.  But he was just asking.  He'd also like a doughnut, too.<br />
        <b>Who are all the Your Sanctuary guardians capable of using PSI?</b>  Titanic Ant.  Mondo Mole.  Trillionage Sprout.  Shrooom!  And Diamond Dog.  Electro Specter and Thunder & Storm have attacks which <i>emulate</i> PSI but are not actually PSI.  Carbon Dog and Plague Rat of Doom do not.  I think.<br />
    <b>Where does Aygo Stikke live?</b>  First, kudos to the one person who pointed out that his name is technically Ay-Go Stikke.  (Note the hyphen.  I didn't have my cartridge with me and wasn't in the mood to verify it through Other Means.)  He lives in the Lost Underworld Tenda Village.  (Also accepted were: Tenda Village II, Lost Underworld.  Not accepted was "Tenda Village" because two exist.) </p>

<p>This week on <i>Jeo</i>--err, Trivia, our champions were BlueAntoid, CPTCrunch, EBisumaru, epoch, FalconPain and zztman.</p>
