Here are a few basic guidelines to keep in mind when submitting fanfiction:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>All fanfics <i>must</i> be submitted in .html, .rtf, .txt, or .doc format.</b> No other formats will be accepted. Please convert any .docx files (Word 2007) to .doc (Word 2003) version prior to submission.</li><br />
<li><b>Fanfic filenames <i>must</i> be lowercase and cannot contain spaces.</b> It also helps to have numbers for serial fanfics (ie. "union1.htm," "union2.htm," etc.)</li><br />
<li><b>All fanfics must be <i>at least</i> 500 words in length.</b> (One page, single spaced 12 pt. font) Note that titles and author commentary will not count towards this total.</li><br />
<li><b>No fanfic may contain <i>excessive</i> profanity, sexual content, or be overly violent or stupid.</b> A fanfic with more mature themes should be clearly labelled at the beginning of the story or the chapter that the content is present in.  Submissions with a large amount of mature content will be judged on a case-by-case basis for quality of writing or gratuitous use of questionable content.</li><br />
<li><b>Scripts will not be accepted.</b></li><br />
<li><b>Try to be as grammatically-correct as possible. Good spelling and punctuation is encouraged as well.</b> Most word processors have a spelling and grammar-check feature. If you have no word processor, try <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>, which is an open source office suite. Fics with terrible spelling, grammar, or sentence structure will be rejected.</li><br />
<li><b>No plagiarism.</b> Stealing other people's works is bad, mmmkay?</li>
</ul>

Please be patient while waiting for submissions to be processed. Fan-fiction is generally updated every Monday, and an individual story can take up to two weeks to appear, due to various circumstances. Please refrain from making inquires until at least two Mondays from the time of submission.

In order to submit anything to Starmen.Net, you need to create a <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/">forum account</a>. This site is integrated with the forums to create gigantic database that makes for easier navigation and editing (good for both visitors and staffers). Don't be shy!  We always love to meet new EarthBound fans. (You don't need to post on the forums to submit anything to the site.)<br /><br />

Please go <a href="http://starmen.net/submit/">here</a> to submit your fanfic.
