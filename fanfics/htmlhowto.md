So you're going to write a fanfic, but you don't want it in that ugly .txt format? Then your best option is the lovely HTML format. You've got two choices here.<br/><br/>
1) Use a word processor HTML compiler. Not a bad option, but this usually isn't friendly to most browsers.<br/>
2) Write out the HTML yourself. A grueling process, but ultimately more rewarding.<br/><br/>
Personally I recommend writing the HTML yourself. It does take a lot more work, but hand written HTML is usually lighter, cleaner and more friendly to all browsers. If you're ready to tread the path of HTMLization then follow me.
