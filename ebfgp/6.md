Welcome to Happy Happy Village where everything is just so dang blue. Beyond a budding religious culture there's also the local caves and a blue cow. But that's not what were here for. Check out the local caves for any missing maidens, pick up a reflective badge and depose a cult leader.<br /><br />

Find Paula in the lonely cabin, get the Franklin Badge and take out Carpainter.

<ul>
<li>Don't steal eggs. It's wrong. If you need Eggs, pay at least 110 dollars for them. In otherwords, don't buy from that basket. :)</li>
<li>Fight 20 Happy Happyists in one battle. However, you can't have either the Hard Hat, or the Copper Bracelet equipped.</li>
<li>Don't use any PSI against Carpainter. This includes healing PSI.</li>
<li>Donate all your money to that annoying lady. Do it two dollars at a time until your inventory is full of Picture Postcards.</li>
<li>Fill Paula's inventory entirely with cookies you win from Spiteful Crows.</li>
<li>Fight 10 coil snakes.</li>
<li>Get Paula to level 10 by fighting crows outside the cabin. Don't go into the cave until she's at level 10.</li>
</ul>

 Here's an interesting change. The Happy Happyists are strikingly similar to the Ku Klux Klan. Obviously, Nintendo couldn't condone this. So what did they do? Well, as you can see from the picture, the "HH" mark is erased, and there's a fluffy ball at the end of the hat. I guess that makes it less evil or something.<br /><br />
