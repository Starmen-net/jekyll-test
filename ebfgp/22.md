Where the banshees live, and they do live well!  Apple Kid and Dr. Andonuts are the only ones with the know-how to build you a Phase Distorter, so it's imperative that you rescue them post-haste.  And while you're in the base, why not have a quick look around for any royal swords that the guards might be carrying?  Or maybe some broken musical instruments?  Why does Giygas need so much broken stuff, anyway?  Some kind of diabolical plot, no doubt.  Once you've shut down the base, save your game.<br />

<ul>
<li>Get one of your characters Diamondnized before entering Stonehenge, and keep it that way. Choose wisely.  I chose Picky, what a mistake <i>that</i> turned out to be.</li>
<li>Again, no bottle rockets!  Always with the no bottle rockets!  Ay yi yi!</li>
<li>Only PSI Thunder can be used against Starman DX.  And maybe a couple of physical attacks.  No Neutralizer or Shield Killer, that would spoil my fun.</li>
<li>Get the Sword of Kings, then give it away to Escargo Express.  Hey, they can handle your Pencil Eraser, I'm sure they'll be fine with a lousy sword.</li>
<li>Reset your game if you gain more than five levels per party member while looking for the Sword.  You wouldn't want to skip that massive boost in Magicant.</li>
<li>Use your Casey Bat during the entire GPP.  On the rare occasions that it connects, it tends to do around 800 damage.  It'll also raise your attack stat, giving you a better chance for a surprise instant-win.  I guess that's not really a challenge, is it?</li>
</ul>

Instead of a stone eraser, Mother 2 features a "limbless wooden doll" in the Stonehenge base.  It's actually a pun that loses its meaning in translation.  This is completely different from the fact that Mother 2's Picnic Lunch contains an "octopus hot-dog," which is just a weird joke that foreigners don't get.<br />
