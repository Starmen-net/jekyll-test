You look stronger for some reason. Have you gained power? In any case head back to Threed (If you didn't already) and catch a bus for Fourside. I foresee a herd of buffalo in your future so prepare to walk the scorching desert. Pack some food as you never know when you might meet a hungry stranger. Once you get to the big city head over to the Monotoli offices and visit that oaf you called a neighbor and his father. Afterwards get your fanny back to the desert and save in the Miner's shack. The action happens tomorrow.<br /><br />

 When Tomato first saw this part of Mother 2, he thought that the Japanese writers made some weird mistakes, since the syllables are mixed up in some places. But apparently this is a part of Japanese slang. This makes the guy look like a total dolt and stuff. So it was obviously intentional. But for some reason he gets girls from both towns. WHY?!<br /><br />
