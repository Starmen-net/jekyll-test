This is what it looks like inside of your head.  You're not insane!  Humans are just complex creatures, full of love and peace and groovy colours.  Of course, there's also your bad side out in the Sea of Eden.  Confront your fears and show 'em who's boss!<br />

<ul>
<li>If you have the Franklin Badge, store it away.  Same goes for the Sea Pendant.  I'm not completely evil; you can have an Earth Pendant, if you like.  Mwahahaha!</li>
<li>Can you defeat Ness's Nightmare, and still have a Flying Man with you?</li>
<li>Pick a fight with some Fixed Dice, and let it fill the screen with enemies before you begin attacking it.  If you can win <i>that</i> battle, you're a pretty darn good player!</li>
<li>Equip the Baseball Cap that you give yourself, and keep it equipped until you beat Giygas.</li>
</ul>

OMG HE'S NEKKID!  No, you don't need a Gameshark to see this; that's actually how Ness looks in Mother 2's version of Magicant.  If you want more proof but can't be bothered to learn Japanese so you can get this far in the game, check out <a href="http://fobby.net/m2eb/magicant.shtml">Tomato's page</a>, which has more screenshots.  Just don't come crying to us when seeing naked Ness makes you curl up on your floor and shiver.<br />
