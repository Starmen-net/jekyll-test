 EarthBound Funktastic Gameplay (or EBFGP), is an event that started approximately six years ago. The idea of this event was to get all Starmen.net visitors to play EarthBound again. The reason for this is because it's clear that even with all the fanbase that this site is creating, there are still many visitors that either haven't played EarthBound in a long while, never completed the game, or never played the game at all. So in order to get the visitors "Back in the Game", we're holding this event so all visitors can play the game at once, uniformly, right up until the end.

 EBFGP will be updated from Monday to Saturday every week. On these days, new gameplay points (GPPs) are issued. These GPPs are specific areas that you play up to in the game. For example, the first GPP would be the Naming Characters Screen to Buzz Buzz's death. You play the game up until Buzz Buzz dies. Once he does, you save your game, and don't play past that point until the next update. This is all done so visitors can play the game as one, and discuss their experiences. Sunday is a "catch-up" day, for people who might have fallen behind in the game play points.<p></p>

It must also be made clear that EBFGP is <b>NOT</b> a contest. So there are no prizes or anything for what you may accomplish in the game. It is nearly impossible to make a reasonable contest out of an event such as this.

 Besides Gameplay Points, there will also be several subsections for this event. These include Challenges for the GPPs. These challenges make for a much more interesting experience when playing EarthBound. There are also Mother 2 factoids that examine some of the differences between Mother 2 and EarthBound, and Mother 2 Translation Tables for those of you playing imported copies of the game. There is also an exclusive forum for you to discuss with other visitors about some of the neat things you've seen in the game, or brag about how many challenges you managed to complete. And of course there is a different EB Quote for every update.<p></p>

With all these things to do, just make sure you have fun when you're playing EarthBound along with everyone else (whether you do the challenges or not).<p></p>
