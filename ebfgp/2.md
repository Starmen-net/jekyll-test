So Buzz Buzz has cashed in his chips and has left you all by your lonesome. Well nobody ever said saving the world was going to be easy. Before you head out into the wide world perhaps you should prove yourself a hero at home. Trouncing some local ruffians might do the trick.<br /><br/>

Take on Frank and the Sharks and as soon as you've given them a thorough thrashing go on and save and stop for the day. You've done enough work for the day.

<ul>
<li>Can you beat Frank before you reach level 5? Most ladies really like those macho types.</li>
<li>Or else you can be a total manly man and hit level 20 first.</li>
<li>Only use Cookies and Fruit Juice to recover your health.</li>
</ul>

Remember how if you talk to Pokey after he's punished ("No dessert for the rest of the decade")? Instead of that, he says that his "butt hurts". This suggests that he's been spanked. In my day, annoying fat kids were spanked till the cows came home. An' that's tha way we liked it!<br /><br />

Finally, the goofy Beatles quiz "XXXterday", was really the following in Mother 2: "The girl from the Alps named OOdi". You would fill the OO with hai (yes) or iie (no). I think it's that girl named "Heidi". Was that from a movie or something?<br /><br />

All this and more can be discovered on Tom Ato's <a href="http://starmen.net/m2eb/">Mother 2 to EarthBound and Back Again</a> website. Be sure to use it for all your wacky comparison needs.
