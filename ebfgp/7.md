Well now that you've rescued yon maiden perhaps you can learn a new tune. This may be even the occasion to help some poor guys get out of trouble. Maybe they'll help you go places!<br /><br />

Claim the Lilliput Steps melody (You <i>could</i> do it out of order if you want), help the Runaway Five break away from the Chaos Theater and hop a ride to Threed where you can save for the time being.

<ul>
<li>Can you win a Teddy Bear from the Mighty Bear?</li>
<li>Keep Paula alive for the entire GPP.</li>
<li>Alternatively, let Paula die off, then walk around Twoson and talk to important people like Everdred, Paula's parents, and the Runaway Five. It's not really a challenge per se, but it's neat to see the different messages, and a future challenge will involve having Paula at level 1.</li>
<li>Keep Paula's Teddy Bear "alive".</li>
<li>Don't use Paralysis on the Mondo Mole.</li>
<li>Beat Mondo Mole with Paula at Level 1 and have her alive at the end of the battle.</li>
</ul>

 One relatively large difference between Mother 2 and EB is the Tonzura Brothers/Runaway Five. Tonzura essentially means "escape", or in this case "Runaway". So it should really be the Runaway Brothers. If you're not much of a moviegoer, this is a pretty direct reference to the Blues Brothers. Also, notice how all their costumes are black instead of different colors. This was probably because Nintendo wanted to avoid copyright issues again. Nevertheless, this explains the eerie 6th member of the Runaway Five, since "Five" is really supposed to be "Brothers".<br /><br />
