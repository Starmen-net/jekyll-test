Paula's been kidnapped. Isn't that just wonderful? Well there's only one thing to do in troubled times like this. Go out for a cup of coffee. Everdred may be in the area so search him out after a nice cup of joe. He may be closer than you think. Take his advice to heart and head to the strange land of Moonside. Fight through the madness and destroy the Mani Mani Statue to reclaim your reality. Then for your final bout of weirdness for the day encounter Escargo Express' Neglected Class. Save before the Monkey Cave.<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>Give the guy who wants something one of your best items, like the Magic Truffle you may have gotten in Twoson. Or you could give him something useless like the Pair of Dirty Socks or a Broken Spray Can, which isn't really a challenge but is pretty funny.</li>
<li>When you fight Robo Pumps, defeat them before they reach 2.</li>
<li>No bottle rockets. (EBounding was pretty adamant about this one, as you'll see in the following GPPs.)</li>
<li>Don't equip the Night Pendant.</li>
<li>People playing Mother 2 on their GBAs: turn your GBA upside down. People playing EarthBound on their SNES: turn your TV upside down. !edisnooM ot emocleW</li>

 There wasn't anything terribly different in during this portion of the game, besides of course the "bar" and "Monotoly" building. In this part though, the person says (roughly translated), "You're mailboxes, and you have a habit of staggering around". Why that had to be changed is just as much of a mystery as Moonside itself.<br /><br />
