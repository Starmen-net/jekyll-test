Now that you've rested it's time to finish the job. Continue to the south. You may lose a friend on the way, but it will be of no real consequence. If by chance you come by a flying machine they take it with haste and rescue somebody. When the rescue is complete search around for an evil mound of fabric. Perhaps this series of events will bring you the answer to defeating the haunting meance.<br /><br />

Head south to the lab, picked up the Sky Runner and save Ness and Paula, fight the Boogey Tent and give the zombies a taste of fatal attraction with some Zombie Paper. As always be sure to save afterwards.

<ul>
<li>Fight 5 Cave Boys (Here are the guidelines; no Cheap Bracelet, and you can only heal yourself with ITEMS).</li>
<li>Get Jeff at least 5 levels ahead of Ness before the end of the GPP.</li>
<li>When in Threed, have only Paula and Jeff attack any enemies. Ness will just defend.</li>
<li>When fighting Boogey Tent, try a battle like this: Only Jeff can attack (not using a big bottle rocket), but Paula can use Pray and Defend, and Ness can defend/use shields on Jeff.</li>
<li>Did you manage to keep both Jeff and Paula at level 1? Great! Now see if you can get both of them to live through the Boogey Tent battle. Mwa ha ha!</li>
</ul>

Another name change. Makes sense though. Labo is lab, and lab is presumably labo. Lobo means wolf in Spanish, so don't confuse the two.<br /><br />

Jonk is a most happy fellow when you give him praise for good work.
