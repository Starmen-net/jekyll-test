Drink your tea and get ready to get deep.  We're talkin' the Lost Underworld today, which is like the Lost Underwear except older and less smelling-like-yoghurt.  Your objectives: slaughter Electro Specter (no problem) and Carbon Dog (slightly more of a problem, especially when he recarbonates into Diamond Dog.)  Then collect your last melody and save in Magicant.<br />

<ul>
<li>I'll keep saying "NO BOTTLE ROCKETS" till the cows come home, and then I'll say it to the cows. Because cows play EarthBound.  Except for the ones in Earthworm Jim.</li>
<li>Continue to use the Casey bat. But if you get something cool like the Gutsy Bat, use that instead. You deserve it!</li>
<li>Get the elusive Broken Antenna. And the Star Pendant. I got a Star Pendant once; it took me three hours and I got all my characters to level 99 before I was done.</li>
<li>A challenge is going to be to defeat Giygas at Lv. 60 or lower.  If you're already over that, go back to the very beginning and try again, getting in fewer fights this time.  Some of us are only level 35!</li>
</ul>

Which is more aesthetically pleasing to the player, the present tense or the past tense?  And how come nobody uses the future tense any more?  "You Will Win" would perk me up during those long battles where half my party dies and then Ness gets Diamondized and it's only Paula and she's all out of PP so she prays and ends up getting the thing where everyone comes back to life and it's Starman DX so of course he's been calling in help left and right and there's like seven Starman Supers now and AAAAGH I'M GONNA DIEEEEEEEE!!!!<br />
<br />
"You Will Win!"<br />
<br />
See how great that'd be?<br />
