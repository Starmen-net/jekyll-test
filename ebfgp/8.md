Welcome to Threed! Not a very bright welcome, not is it? Well let's see what we can do about that. Be sure to scour the town completely. If anyone stares into your soul it's a sign that you need to lay down at the local inn. Hopefully nothing cruel will befall you there. Perhaps during this whole experience you'll be able to live the life of another soul. If you do head south and if by chance you go through a maze be sure to end the day at the end.<br /><br />

Check out the graveyard, get knocked out by the Zombie Babe, switch to Jeff and head south to Brick Road's maze where you'll save at the end. The end of the maze, that is.

<ul>
<li>Get both Ness and Paula possessed, and keep them that way for as long as possible.</li>
<li>Patrol the streets of Threed and fight all enemies that are sitting in the road. Yell, "Die, freako Belch minion!" each time you get into a fight. Do this until Ness's dad calls, and then yell "WHO YA GONNA CALL?!" before answering the phone.</li>
<li>Purchase the T-Rex Bat.</li>
<li>Avoid or run from every battle in Winters so that Jeff is level 1 when he reaches Threed.</li>
</ul>

 Here's an obvious change. Threed, is really Threek. You can see this in old issues of Nintendo Power, and I believe in the player's guide. Why was it changed? I dunno. Maybe Threed looks more "American" or something.<br /><br />

That Jonk is a really great guy for making these tables. Let's all give him a hug for it.
