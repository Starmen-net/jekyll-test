Are you ready for a couple of rough rides?  First, you're off to Dalaam with your newfound Carrot Key to pick up the sixth melody, and then it's back to Summers to take a cruise.  Don't forget your Kraken-proof slippers!<br />

<ul>
<li>Don't use offensive PSI on the Kraken. No Big Bottle Rockets and Super Bombs, either!  Do it by hand!</li>
<li>Throw the Pair of Dirty Socks at the Kraken if you still have them. That way it won't seem so silly that the Captain threw his slippers at the beast.</li>
<li>Collect all the Pink Cloud items before you face Thunder and Storm.  But don't actually <i>use</i> any of them.  Extra defence for Poo?  Unthinkable!</li>
<li>When facing Thunder and Storm, have Ness get in one SMAAAAAASH! attack before they are defeated.  Without a Sudden Guts Pill.  And with a Cracked Bat.</li>
</ul>

You know that hospital in Summers where they prescribe two weeks of sun and sand and a few ounces of morphine for your troubles?  Well, in Mother 2, that hospital had a cross on it.  In fact, all the hospitals had crosses, but they were edited out during localization.  Apparently, crosses are too religious for American audiences in any context.  I'm probably blacklisted from the Nintendo Fun Club just for mentioning it.<br />
