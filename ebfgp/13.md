Now it's time to get to the nitty-gritty of things. It's a short point here, but it's nothing short of non-stop action. There's a mole infestation and only you can take them out. I believe there's five in all so once you've wiped them out save for the day.<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>Don't use Freeze or Bottle Rockets on the Guardian Diggers. Think of other clever ways to beat them.</li>
<li>Collect every item in the Mole Maze, before you FIGHT the moles (exclude the items behind the moles).</li>
<li>Have the enemy surprise attack you every time.</li>
<li>Don't use any Life Noodles.</li>
<li>Apologize to each Guardian Digger every time you attack them and ultimately defeat them. Explain that you don't mean to remove them from their natural habitat, but it's a necessary evil in order to save the world. Maybe if you can get them to realize that Giygas is going to crush them if you don't succeed, you can get them to cooperate.</li>
</ul>

 There aren't very many changes in Dusty Dunes, so we'll just look at Fourside. As you can see in the picture, "Department" was changed to "Dept. Store", to show stupid American children that it is a store. There were several other slight name changes in Fourside as well. Such as the Topolla Theater called "Topollo" and the Monotoli building being called "Monotoly". I guess the "i" makes it sound Italian, and therefore very sinister and evil. Or maybe they just thought it was too much like "Monopoly" and didn't want to get sued.<br /><br />
