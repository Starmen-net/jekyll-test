You're now in control of a nice-eyed Dalaamesian prince, so do what comes naturally: meditate on nothingness.  Ommmm.  Once you've got your Mu in place, hook up with the rest of the party and take in some museums.  I heard they've got this new exhibit in Fourside where you meet a real live sewer rat!<br />
<br />

<ul>
<li>Avoid at least one of the Shattered Men in the Summer's Museum. This is important if you want to do an... <i>interesting</i> challenge later.</li>
<li>Don't use Paralysis in the sewers.  I never do anyway.  It's like saying "Don't use Defence Down."</li>
<li>Can you defeat the Plague Rat of Doom with PSI Flash? No other offensive attacks can be used.  Extra credit if you manage it with Flash Alpha, or maybe not, I think that's impossible.</li>
<li>Collect every item before you face the PRoD, then leave the sewer and fix all the broken stuff, then come back and beat the Rat without using the Heavy Bazooka.  Mmm, I love trudging through all this sludge.</li>
<li>Try to get the Carrot Key without setting off the melody at Magnet Hill.  Of course, you'll have to go back to get it later if you do this.  It's more inconvenient than anything else.</li>
</ul>

As you can see from the picture, Topollo was changed to Topolla. "Topollo" sounds a lot like "Apollo" so maybe that's why they changed it?  Two more interesting changes are our old pals Mr. Spoon and Mr. Fork; they're actually called Mr. Ricebowl and Mr. Chopstick, respectively. Hooray for culture!<br />

Now, we all know that Jonk did these charts, right?  But did you <i>also</i> know that me, the SB, did all the cutting and pasting?  It was like a team effort!  GO TEAM!
