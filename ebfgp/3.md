Well now you're a local hero. Good on you. Perhaps you can finally collect a special key from the local politico and climb your way to the first Sanctuary. Beware of local cops on the way down though. <br /><br />

Collect the key to the Entertainer's Shack, climb through the caves and claim Giant Step as your own. After chatting with the cop at the bottom of the hill go home and save.

<ul>
<li>Don't use the Magic Butterflies. Easy PSI recovery would make everything... well... easy.</li>
<li>Defeat Titanic Ant at level 7 or less. Again with the macho stuff.</li>
<li>No Life Up. All those free cookies you find will be sad.</li>
</ul>

 Here's a strange difference in the game. That red truck that you see every once in a while doesn't have that little man on it, but rather something that looks like the Coca-Cola logo. That was the most probable reason Nintendo changed that; copyright issues. Or it just plain doesn't make sense (but lots of stuff in EB doesn't).<br /><br />
