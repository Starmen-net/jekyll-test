The Monkey Cave. Remember that in this territory three things are of the utmost importance.<br /><br />
1) A Skip Sandwich<br />
2) A Picnic Lunch<br />
3) A Pencil Eraser<br /><br />
If you have these then you are prepared. Once you reclaim the almighty Yogurt Machine, burn rubber back to Fourside and fight your way through the Monotoli Building to save Paula. Hop a ride back to Threed, fly back to Winters and save when you get to the lab.<br /><br />

 This guy in Mother 2 sort of says the same thing as his EarthBound counterpart, except instead of Solitare, he mentions he lost at Monopoly. Like many various changes, this one was probably due to trademark issues. Of course, it's also interesting that the guy in EarthBound doesn't say that he just lost, but that he lost his shirt. Many people originally thought the Mother 2 version would mention "Strip Poker". But it seems this guy was playing "Strip Solitare"? It's disturbing any way you cut it.<br /><br />
