The territory of Twoson greets you with open arms. Take in the sights and learn of the local populace. Knowledge can be found even in the seediest of locales. Perhaps you can even fund some young researcher and help him along the path to greatness. If nothing else you could always head East.<br /><br />

Fight Everdred, give Apple Kid some food and money, chat with Paula's parents, attempt to get through Peaceful Rest Valley, return to Twoson and get the Pencil Eraser and make your way to Happy Happy Village where we shall stop for the day.

<ul>
<li>Spend all your money so you have nothing in your account or on hand. We all go on those crazy little sprees.</li>
<li>Invest in Orange Kid. The full $200. No waiting until he lowers his price. Then use the Super Orange Machine instead of selling it. The ladies usually go for the eccentric type.</li>
<li>Stay "Mashroomized" through the entire GPP. We all are a tad bit crazy.</li>
<li>Keep a cold for the entire GPP. Maybe you can destroy the Happy Happiests with a cold.</li>
<li>Collect 10 toothbrushes. Gotta keep those molars pearly white.</li>
<li>Make $1000 in five minutes. (NO SELLING ANY KIND OF POULTRY!) Gotta make the Trump proud.</li>
</ul>

 One change in EarthBound is the Squid-Pencil statue change. You can find this change in your player's guide (page 44 for example), or old Nintendo Powers that review EarthBound. Essentially, Octopus, was replaced with Pencil. For example, in Mother 2, Apple Kid tells you not to use the "Octopus Erasing Machine" near a shop that sells octopi (or statues thereof). There's not really much more to try to explain since the whole thing doesn't make sense. :)<br /><br />
