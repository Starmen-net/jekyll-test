It is here. That wonderfully funktastic event that raises the hair in your ears. This is the one your parents warned you about. Hide your grandma, grate the cat, stuff the pizza because it's time for the annual EarthBound Funktastic Gameplay Summer 2006! For those of you who are new to our fair lands you may be asking yourself: What is EBFGPS?<br /><br />

The abridged version: Synchronized EarthBound. The full version: See our wonderful <a href="http://staff.starmen.net/ebfgp/about.php">About</a> page. In any case let's get this shindig started.<br /><br /> 

What better place to start a whole new game than at those most humble location everyone seems to take for granted; the beginning. Surely you didn't think we were going to start elsewhere? Let's take this one step at a time.<br /><br /> 

So give the characters whatever wacky names you can come up with that fit within five to six characters. Then wake up, check out the meteorite, go back to sleep, wake up again, agree to help annoying neighbor, rescue neighbor's little brother, discover awesome destiny, fight Starman Jr., watch Not A Bee die and get the Sound Stone. Then go home and save. I hope you wrote all that down because I'm not repeating it again.<br />

Are the overall challenges just a bit much for you? Well if you still want a little spice with your EB experience, but don't want the hassle of the overall challenges then the Daily Challenges are for you. Daily Challenges only apply to the GPP of the day so you get a unique experience for every day.<br /><br /> 

<li>Be a good boy and refill the cookie jar. Bring home 10 cookies.</li>
<li>Avoid all the fights you can. We're in peace time, soldier.</li>
<li>Don't ask your dog for any help. I'm sure he'd rather be lazy and stay on the rug anyways.</li>
<li>Don't equip the Cracked Bat. It's taken enough of a beating as it is.</li>

Obviously your travels won't be easy. Giygas has thrown opposition in your path and he's going to do everything he can to stop you. Fortunately I'm not all that big on the end of all reality so I'm gonna give you the 411 on any potential foe you'll run into.<br /><br />
