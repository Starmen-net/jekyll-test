Some people are content just to play through EarthBound as it is, but there are a few (You know who you are) that need a little extra zest to their gameplay. Well if you're one of those zesty people then this section is for you. Here you'll be able to find special little challenges to keep you hopping through the event. Can you do these challenges, keep your sanity and keep up with everyone else? Well... that's up to you.<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>Play with Slow text. During battle this'll increase the time between your actions forcing you to think ahead and more quickly. Suggested by Windy Rat.</li>
<li>Weapons. Armor. Trinkets. A Jedi needs not these things. Get through the game without any equipment.</li>
<li>Don't use any healing PSI at all. That'd be far too easy my friend.</li>
<li>Only use physical attacks in battle. Beat your foes the old fashioned way.</li>
<li>Are you a bad enough dude(tte) to get <i>all</i> the 1/128 items? Try your luck and don't forget your <a href="http://starmen.net/ebfgp/items.php">item guide</a></li>
<li>Don't spend any money unless you absolutely have to. If it doesn't move the game along then you don't need it.</li><br /><br />
</ul>
Obviously you can't do all these together (A few of them conflict with each other)so just pick the ones you like and go to it. The same applies to the Daily Challenges.
