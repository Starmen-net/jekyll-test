You have successfully claimed the first Sanctuary, but the local law enforcement agency is not happy with your trespassful deeds. Perhaps you can go down to the station and attempt to explain. Maybe you can even use your heroic status to convince them to open the path to a new town.<br /><br />

Head down to the police station, fight Strong and his men, then travel to Twoson and save for the day.

<li>Use only one recovery item. It's how the real men do it.</li>
<li>Don't use your PSI Special. You're trying to teach them a lesson. Not beat them senseless.</li>
<li>Buy the Seaside Home. Nothing like being 13 and having your own shack.</li>
</ul>

 Although there aren't many more visual changes in Onett, there is a small one with the hospital (and all the hospitals). The Onett Hospital used to have a red cross. But Nintendo of America dubbed it out with some small text.
