Now that you're done playing exterminator for a day perhaps we can get back to the important business at hand. After saying your goodbyes to the miners head back to Fourside (Don't worry. Your reward will come to you.) and visit the fabulous Topolla Theater to rescue that wacky band once again. Afterwards reward yourself with a shopping spree at the newly re-opened Fourside Department Store. Be sure to keep an eye on any maidens traveling with you as they have a tendancy to disappear inside malls. If you manage to escape from any mall horrors be sure to save and take a break.<br /><br />

 Big change. The cafe turns out to be a bar. Here you'll find all the drunken lowlifes of Fourside. As a result, NOA replaced "alcohol" with caffeine throughout the whole game. Furthermore, the name of the bar/cafe in Mother 2 is "Boruhesu's Bar." Is it just me or does 'Boruhesu' sound like the Japanese way of saying Boris? Maybe he's waiting for moose und squirrel to show up...<br /><br />
