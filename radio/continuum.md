The Warbird is good for intermediate players, with it's capable speed (and rockets to go faster), and bullets obliterating enemy ships in the blink of an eye, the Warbird is a nice touch for anyone settling in.

<p>
The Warbird Tournament will take place at Midnight through 12:30 AM, EST, on January 27th.

The Javelin is built just as the Warbird, with <b>three</b> additional perks: the ability to repel, more energy to withstand more bullets, and the ability to use afterburners without taking away energy.  Even with more energy, the Javelin's bullet takes more energy to use than a Warbird's bullet, this essentially makes it more of a defensive ship.  When dealing with an onslaught of bullets, bombs, and fighters, nothing is more convenient than repelling everybody and taking a quick rocket away.

The spiders may have weak bullets, but they are effective when used along with it's powerful bombing.  They also come with bursts and an array of rockets and a portal, so should you happen to be stuck in a small area with someone gunning you down, it's easy to hit the bursts and rocket, or port out of your predicament.  They're slow by other ship's standards, but at least it's not as slow as a Leviathan.

The Spider Tournament will take place at Midnight through 12:30 AM, EST, on February 3rd.

<p>
Leviathans are ideal for "lancing" your opponent, lancing being the term for rocketing toward an opponent and shooting in a straight line in hopes of ravaging your enemy with a reaming death.  At the same time, the very powerful bullets also burn more energy when shot, so use caution.  Despite being a slow ship, they can also bomb, with an EMP element, so shooting your opponent with a bomb not only takes out their energy, but actually <B>stops</B> them from regaining energy for a matter of time.

The Leviathan Tournament will take place at 12:30 AM through 1:00 AM, EST, on February 3rd.
