<p>
Sending your request through e-mail is the best way, just make sure to include an mp3 unless you're sure the DJ has it.  If you have a request for a song a DJ doesn't have, and you can't send it to them, don't expect the DJ to find it themself!  That being said, send in those requests!

All DJs use GMail at present, so just substitute the names below into "DJNAMEHERE@gmail.com"
