<font size="5">Fridays</font><br /><br />

<font size="3">9:00 PM - Midnight = DJ Mon Digital Monsters </font><br />
The Wild Card show of Radio PSI where the format keeps changing from week to week. One week, might be a talk show among his co-hosts. <br />
Another week, it could be a simple game session with another. The next week, Gran Turismo racing on his personal setup? <br /> 
How about some Truck simulator? Which co-hosts will be present this week? The only way to know what is happening is to tune in. <br />

<font size="5">Saturdays</font><br /><br />

<font size="3">9:00 PM - Midnight = <a href="http://twitch.tv/amzrigh">DJ AmzTrak's Throne of Games</a> </font> <br />
DJ AmzTrak's Primary show. It is the de facto Gaming stream of Radio PSI as DJ AmzTrak and his co-hosts go for the longhauls as they feature a variety of games. <br />

<br />


<font size="5">Sundays</font><br /><br />

<font size="3">9:00 PM - 11:00 PM = DJ Umbra's Shadow Waves of Radio</font><br />
The "classic style" format of Radio PSI where music and talk remain the main ingredients. <br /> Though the show is mostly centered around game music and game-related news, anything like tabletop, anime, hardware, technology, etc. can be discussed. <br /> It's the end of the week-end. We just want to relax before it's time to go back to work. <br />
<font size="3">(<a href="http://icecast.fobby.net/radiopsi.ogg.m3u">Audio stream</a> and <a href="http://twitch.tv/radiopsi">Video Stream</a>)</font><br />

<br /><br />

<font size="5">Thursdays</font><br /><br />

<font size="3">9:00 PM - 11:00 PM = <a href="http://twitch.tv/amzrigh">DJ Amztrak's Thursday Throne</a></font><br />
DJ AmzTrak cannot and will not limit himself to a single night per week. <br /> Thursday Throne is a secondary Gaming stream in-which he plays through a second game that isn't being featured on the Throne of Games. <br /> Being a week night, it is mostly him and maybe a roommate or two compared to the main show, but the games must go on. <br />

<br /><br />

<font size="5">Random Weekday(s) of the Week?</font><br /><br />

<font size="3">Around 9:00 PM, may vary depending of coordination needs = <a href="http://twitch.tv/radiopsi">RPG Club</a></font><br />
When life and work allow it, DJ Mon will call upon one of his crew once a week to feature a RPG game to play through various game sessions until the end. <br /> Though it all started with EarthBound, there is so many RPGs out there that deserve a time in the spotlight. <br /> If this is your genre of games, you're at the right place. <br />
