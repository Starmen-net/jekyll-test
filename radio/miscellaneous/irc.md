Listening to the radio, but alone?  There's no need to feel down, you've got a whole playground of friends in #RadioPSI on the Thinstack IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.  We're sometimes unpopulated when a show isn't airing (though there are regulars to be found in #radiopsi 24/7), but you can stop by during our shows, and have some fun with your fellow starmen!  Not to mention, it's the place to be if you want to take a firsthand look at the zaniness during a game of WHO ARTED?! or the anticipation of naming the thing that the ring is from... thing!

So what the cow are you waiting for?  Find your favorite IRC client, and join us every weekend!  (AND, if you've got <b>mIRC</b> or <b>Chatzilla</b>, click the sweet, handy link we have below to totally get straight to the channel!)

<p>
If you have an IRC client, you can try <a href="irc://irc.thinstack.net/radiopsi">irc://irc.thinstack.net/radiopsi</a> or, if you don't have one, you can try <a href="http://chat.thinstack.net/?nick=&channels=radiopsi">Thinstack's browser client</a> or <a onClick="document.getElementById('javaIRC').innerHTML='&lt;iframe src=\'http://chat.thinstack.net/?nick=&channels=radiopsi\' width=\'647\' height=\'400\'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';">click here</a> and use it right from this page.

For more on IRC, check out Starmen.net's <a href="http://starmen.net/chat" target="_blank">Chat</a> section on the sidebar, it provides helpful information regarding IRC, as well as about Starmen.net's official #starmen channel, and how to get there instead of to the #radiopsi channel.
