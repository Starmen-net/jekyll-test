Let's Talk About Radio

It's been a busy time for Radio PSI lately; <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Site/Newsroom/406026809/1922701">version 6.83.2 was released</a>, we've got a <a href="http://starmen.net/radio/djs/buddies.php">host of new Buddies</a>, and we've increased our use of our <a href="http://twitch.tv/radiopsi">video shows and simulcasts</a>. Now, it's time to tell us what you think about Radio PSI.

Are you a long-time listener who's been with us over the years? Are you a new listener from the past months? Is this the first you've heard about us at Radio PSI? Stop by our <a href="link goes here">Feedback topic</a> and let us know what you like, what you don't like, and how we can serve you better.

OK, on to Round 2!

Here's the current list:

# Chrono Trigger
# Star Ocean 2: The Second Story
# Disgaea: Hour of Darkness
# Pokemon R/G/B
# Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu
# Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
# Final Fantasy III/VI
# Dragon Quest VIII
# Tales of Symphonia
# Castlevania: Symphony of the Night


For your turn you can *either*:

* Replace any one game in the list with any RPG not on the list.
* Switch the positions of two games already on the list.

Remember that the idea is to make a move that *you* feel strongly about. Don't worry about what other people think, but please don't just reverse a decision from a previous round.

Sometimes changes will happen and get undone in a round, but that's inevitable since this is done in secret. Thus, don't worry about it.

Now, gl hf dd.
