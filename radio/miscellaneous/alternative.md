<p>First, make sure that there is supposed to be a DJ currently broadcasting, by checking on the <a href="http://starmen.net/radio/schedule.php">Radio PSI Schedule</a>, or find out if there's a show on in Radio PSI's IRC chat room by connecting to Thinstack with your IRC client and when you're connected, type /join #radiopsi (alternately, if you have mIRC or Chatzilla already, clicking the following link will likely get you there: <a href="irc://irc.thinstack.net/radiopsi">irc://irc.thinstack.net/radiopsi</a>).</p> 

<p>You can also stay up to date with Radio PSI by following it on <a href="http://twitter.com/RadioPSI">Twitter</a></p>

The best popular method of connecting to Radio PSI is through WinAmp, but sometimes, people still have trouble connecting.  If you are having trouble, first, make sure you're using the latest version of WinAmp, and if you aren't, upgrade it and restart your computer.  If you DO have the latest version already, try restarting your computer anyway.</p>

<p>
As good or better than WinAmp, Foobar2000 is another excellent option for Windows users. If Foobar2000 is not working for you, upgrade to the latest version, then restart your computer. If you DO have the latest version already, try restarting your computer anyway.</p>

<p>
However, the very easiest way to connect to Radio PSI is to use the handy <a href="http://starmen.net/radio/java.php">Java Radio</a> option, which works for most everyone. The drawback is that is does not indicate the artist and song playing very well, and it does not have volume control.</p>

<p>It's not Windows users that are our only listeners either, we have people with Macs, Linux, or something else trying to tune in but don't know a good music player that they can listen in with.  When push comes to shove, we're here with suggestions for alternatives to make sure you don't miss a second of your favorite Radio PSI programming.
</p>

<p>
The best alternative that we can suggest in this department is VLC. If is not working for you, upgrade to the latest version, then restart your computer. If you DO have the latest version already, try restarting your computer anyway.
</p>

<p>
Linux users can also use mplayer or xmms.
