Hosted by an old Radio PSI favorite, DJ Seph G, Radio PSI Podcasts are an alternative to tuning into our 3-hours-a-day, 3-days-a-week weekend shows.  If you can't connect, if you're too busy, or if you just plain don't like us  :(  have a taste of DJ Seph G in Radio PSI Podcast form, coming soon!
</p>

<p>
Radio PSI Podcasts are a recorded show, with no live element, featuring Seph G providing all sorts of EarthBound and Starmen.net-related news, in between bits of EarthBound-related music and humor, game strategies, community birthdays, auction listings and commentary, and maybe, just maybe, pre-recorded interviews with your favorite Starmen.net personalities.  With Mother 3 just around the corner, you'd be <i>drop dead <b>stupid</b></i> not to chill with DJ Seph G and the Radio PSI Podcast!
</p>

<p>
Radio PSI Podcasts will be a bi-weekly event, lasting for one hour.
