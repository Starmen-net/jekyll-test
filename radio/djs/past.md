</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>While DJs and Buddies are normally hired through an application process, DJ Vid Ribbon is a rare exception to this process. He's such an exception to the process, he even missed the naming step when he was hired as a Backup Buddy and went under the guise of Buddy &lt;place name here&gt;!
</p>

<p>Searched out based on his video broadcasting skills seen in his <a href="http://www.earthboundmarathon.com/">Mother's Love</a> and Funkfest broadcasts, DJ Vid Ribbon was hired to be a fill-in for Radio PSI's burgeoning selection of video shows/simulcasts. Over time, he was promoted to DJ and assumed the official name of DJ Vid Ribbon. 
</p>

<p>DJ Vid Ribbon's preferences include games. And Steam. Oh, and sales. And especially sales of games on Steam.
</p>

<p>DJ Vid Ribbon took a extended leave of absence but remains a close collaborator to Radio PSI. Though not officially retired and could return at any time at official capacity, he is not considered part of the active roster. However, once every year, he returns to Radio PSI with a virtual truck to team up with DJ Mon to deliver us A Very Monly Christmas.

</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Restarting the radio craze in 2001, DJ Aquas reopened Starmen.net Radio, which became very popular (and to this day, is still lovingly dubbed "Aqy Radio"), its best week boasting an incredible 140+ listeners. One of his more notorious stunts was playing Dance Dance Revolution's "Seven Jump" and Metal Gear Solid's "Mantis Hymn" for 14 straight hours.
</p>

<p>A combination of being sidetracked and boredom led him to stop broadcasting sometime in 2002-2003, sometime before Radio PSI was created ... however, in July 2008, Aquas was invited to re-join the Radio PSI team, and he happily accepted. Relaunching as DJ Aquazition, he started on Thursday night, dispensing a unique brand of humour and musical goodness. In late May 2009, he moved into a Saturday night spot before eventually settling on Sundays at 9pm.
</p>

<p>
DJ Aquazition was one of the first DJs to start hosting play session style shows with the introduction of his show Game Knight on the Radio PSI Twitch channel. Game Knight is fondly remembered with playthroughs of games such as Shenmue I & II. 
</p>

<p>
His favorite artists include Grandaddy and Boards of Canada, and he enjoys Video Game and Electronic music.
</p>

<p>
DJ Aquazition eventually retired, using his past experiences to go full time on Twitch streaming into both casual gaming and speedrunning.

</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Miss Kame entered the Radio PSI team with an idea for something slightly off the beaten path for Radio PSI -- a  talk show with guests. Dedicated to covering all sorts of topics, from the silly to the serious, from geek and videogame culture to what's going on in the world, her show promises to be an interesting change of pace from most other Radio PSI programming. In November 2009, Miss Kame slipped out of her Buddy outfit and donned the frock of a proper weekend DJ, adding all new dimensions to her show in the process.
</p>

<p>
Miss Kame likes ABBA, Smashing Pumpkins, and Fleetwood Mac. She also has a soft spot for mind-numbing songs (which she of course loves to sing along to). It’s been reported that she has an infatuation with men’s beards and ELO. But mostly beards.
</p>

<p>
Miss Kame eventually retired from Radio PSI having to focus less on the Internet life and more on the real life.

<tr>
<td>
<p>A long-time regular to Radio PSI as a listener and occasional guest on Miss Kame’s talk show, DJ Eggstreme joined the radio team after passing the 2009 tryouts as Buddy Aleggs Treebek. He distinguished himself early as a super-sub, covering for many absent DJs. In 2010, Treebek was promoted and became DJ Eggstreme, claiming a smooth spot in the weekend DJ lineup, and in our hearts.
</p>

<p>DJ Eggstreme’s flagship game segment, “Radio Medley”, tests listeners’ knowledge of popular music. Former flagship game segment “Bizarro Jeopardy” turns right into wrong and wrong into (possibly) right. On occasion, actual games of “Jeopardy!” are played for fun and prizes.
</p>

<p>
DJ Eggstreme is most fond of jazz, soul, R&B and oldies rock – in particular, Bobby Caldwell, The Eagles, The Rippingtons, Seal, and many more.
</p>

<p>
DJ Eggstreme eventually announced his retirement and proceeded to broadcast a show finale before turning over the microphone.

</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>In early of 2009, after encouragement from a former DJ, Edo decided to become more involved in the world of Starmen.Net. Shortly after joining the the IRC chats and listening to Radio PSI, Edo tried out as a Backup Buddy, becoming a full fledged DJ in May 2010. 

Being the cute and small one of the Radio PSI team, Edo does a lot of talking in a high pitch voice  as it comes naturally. She'll talk about how her week has been, talk about any conventions that she has gone to, or just random things that are going on. She'll give a review of her 'Video Game of the Week', covering a random video game and talking about the pros and cons and her 'Anime Spotlight' covers an Anime that she has watched all the way through. Eventually, she has been passed the torch by ozwalled in taking care of 'Who Arted!?', a game in that takes part in the IRC and uses fanart from the Starmen.net's Fan Art section. Edo also loves to sing along with jpop/anime like musics and even plays some music that she's made and posted in her youtube.
</p>

<p>
Edo's favorite genres are JPOP, Anime, Video Games, 80s, 90s, and Remixes while her favorite artists include Perfume, Elton John, Micheal Jackson, No Doubt, Gorillaz, Duane and BrandO, BrentalFloss, YMCK, Utada Hikaru, and M-flo. 
</p>

<p>
Edo the DJ Alchemist eventually announced her retirement and proceeded to make a final show. She eventually found vocations in Twitch, Speedrunning and becoming part of the Game Dones Quick community.

<tr>
<td>
<p>DJ Pollyanna was a long-time listener of the network but was unable to try out for the first few Backup Buddy calls thanks to her weird time zone in the Land of the Rising Sun. She returned to Canada in 2010 and began co-hosting the Who Arted? segment alongside Edobean after DJ Ozztastic officially retired.
</p>

<p>As part of the Buddy Flood of 2011, she became Buddy Third Strongest and she made up the trial Buddies along with Buddy Indie Anna. She quickly proved her consistency and moved up to the role of Full Buddy, filling in for other DJs as needed, before being promoted to DJ to make room for new Buddies, Squire and Breakfast.
</p>

<p>Along with DJ Mon and Edo the DJ Alchemist, DJ Pollyanna provides a certain Eastern flair to Radio PSI. She also rocks it old school with her MOTHER Party, and the crazy side with Scramblefish, Radio PSI's least comprehensible segment.
</p>

<p>
Favourite artists include Barenaked Ladies and The Weakerthans, Vienna Teng, MIKA, Blondie, AiM, Garnet Crow, ZARD and Kuraki Mai. She enjoys Japanese pop and anime music, 80s and 90s pop/rock, cartoon themes and sitcom tunes, and finding omega listener-style music to play for her popular segment Scramblefish.
</p>

<p>
DJ Pollyanna eventually announced her retirement from active duty and broadcasted a final show.

<p>Along with fellow 2012 hires Buddy Squire and Buddy &lt;place name here&gt;, DJ Who was among the most recent additions to the radio family. Beginning as Buddy Breakfast, he always made sure the radio week was full of random and awesome. Radio Shuffle 2014 saw him move to full DJ as he took over Edo the DJ Alchemist's slot while she was on a hiatus dealing with life.
</p>

<p>DJ Who's musical wheel is comprised of primarily Jazz, Classical, Ska, Rock (most kinds), and Chiptune music, but covers just about everything. His favourite bands include Duke Ellington, Weezer, Cherry Poppin’ Daddies, Anamanaguchi, Frédéric Chopin, Miles Davis, Tub Ring, and They Might Be Giants.
</p>

<p>DJ Who eventually asked for an extended leave of absence on February 2021 and has not returned since. Due to lack of contact since then, he was officially declared no longer part of the active roster.

<tr>
<td>
<p>Having used more DJ names than any other Radio PSI DJ, DJ Duckarama (formerly DJ Carp, DJ Jetski Epicmount etc.) has been broadcasting for quite a few years.  He started DJing with Real Life Radio (the radio show of the comic by Greg Dean) and eventually joined RadioPSI in January 2005, as the first of the second generation of Radio PSI broadcasters.  After two years (and a few hiatuses) on the Radio PSI team, he voluntarily retired in March 2007, but was brought back in August of the same year to take an added Friday night slot at the request of Fly-Boi Mathyz.  He retired again a month later.... and THEN came back again in Early 2008, rejuvenated and with a wide array of new on-air segments populating his shows (moreover, he also ran the Continuum Circle Tournament Federation (CTF)).......... and THEN he retired again in October of 2008. He returned in late February 2011, looking forward to helping Radio PSI attain new heights. Speaking of heights, he is still tall enough to pimp-slap Mount Rushmore, so Washington had better watch it.
</p>

<p>
The Duck was joined by his sister Rhonda, dubbed "The Noise" upon his return in 2011, and The Voice joined them for a temporary run in June.
</p>

<p>
His favorite artists include Weezer, Green Day, Billy Talent, Barenaked Ladies, and Pixies.
</p>

<p>
DJ Kobaugh vanished, never to be heard from again at the end of 2011, but The_Noise migrated along with The Voice when he returned to DJ Mon's program in 2012.

<p>DJ γ was sought after as a guest addition to the Radio PSI Mother 3 Release Mega-Bash special in April 2006.  Unlike the fate that befell DJ ß, he was able to be a part of it in the morning, and did a successful job at it.  In the absence of Carpainter, he had also helped restore the Friday night slots with DJ ß. Since his start, DJ γ has fired listeners up with the metal stylings of his "Nuclear Mission Jam" and kept their inner geek happy with the videogame music of his "Secret Soundtracks". In November 2009, DJ γ decided it was time to withdraw from Radio PSI to spend more time in the so-called "real world", to be with "family", "friends" and have a "social life" ... until SMCon 2011, Utahcon, where he decided to return in August of that year ... and then fell off the face of the planet around October.
</p>

<p>
He has no favorite artists or genres.  Ironically, he actually hates music.

<p>DJ ß was sought out as a guest DJ on Radio PSI's Mother 3 Release Mega-Bash special in April 2006, unfortunately, due to technical problems that plagued him that night, he wasn't able to make it to the show.  He would eventually be given his own timeslot on Friday nights, but eventually move to Saturday Nights, made a jump to Sundays following the retirement of DJ Mathyz, effectively reuniting him with DJ γ, only to start the cycle all over again with a subsequent return to Fridays. A consummate professional on the air, the ever-entertaining DJ ß frequently stumps audiences with the challenging "Name the Thing that the Thing is From Thing" game, and his interactive "Works of Fiction" segment has produced some of the most entertaining moments in Radio PSI history. In October 2008, he RE-entered the Saturday midnight slot to the joy of many, and has added a bit of Antithesis to his repertoire.
</p>

<p>
His favorite artist is Meat Loaf. He enjoys 80's and Oldies music.

<p>DJ Ozztastic was hired in early January 2006 after a site-wide résumé search. He proved to be a charismatic, fun, and overall enjoyable addition to the Radio PSI team. In February of 2008, he assumed the leadership role on the Radio PSI team after the retirement of DJ Mathyz. DJ Ozztastic challenged Radio PSI listeners every Saturday with the game "WHO ARTED?!", took the time to snack with "ozwalled Eats" whether you liked it or not, and peppered his audience with a number of other silly segments, like Ask Buttercup and the Joke of the Night. On March 1st, 2011, ozwalled left Radio PSI due to, "Falcon24's unrelenting disrespect and bullying of him and others, and SimonBob's continued tolerance of that unchanging behaviour pattern."
</p>

<p>
His favorite artists include Beck, They Might Be Giants, Sarah Slean, Weezer, The Weakerthans, Richard Cheese, and Rob Zombie. He enjoys all music genres, but particularly enjoys mash-ups.

<tr>

<p>DJ Not-A-DJ, came highly recommended from both DJ ozztastic and DJ Carp, and had past broadcasting experience, which made him a shoe-in to be the first Backup Buddy when the system was implemented in early August 2007.  At the departure of DJ Simon Roberts, Not-A-DJ, being the first Buddy, was the first in line to go from a Buddy to a full-fledged DJ. He soon truly came into his own with a variety of entertaining segments, music of his own creation, and the highly acclaimed radio drama "Fobbies are Borange". Katon eventually left Radio PSI, and his talents were soon picked up by the Fangamer Posdcast, which he currently co-hosts and contributes to.
</p>

<p>
His favorite artists include Bill Eager, Five Iron Frenzy, and Meat Loaf. He enjoys rap, rock and roll, ska, whatever Beck is, and various video game musics just to name a few genres. If you can find a song that DJ Not-a-DJ does not enjoy or appreciate, you get a cookie.

<p>DJ Brewster (who you may know from his art, writing or musical creations, or from his part in "Fobbies Are Borange" or as the lead voice behind the old Poocast) became a DJ in October 2008, after having been Backup Buddy, and was a multi-talented and natural choice for an addition to the Radio PSI team. Ever a creative force, Brewster dazzles listeners with his freshly pressed tracks and awesome segments. Brewster took a short break in 2009 after his old computer exploded into a million billion trillion pieces, and later had returned to action with a new machine at his command. Later that year though, computer problems, coupled with a busy school schedule put him out of action for the forseeable future.
</p>

<p>
Brewster enjoys almost any kind of music, but his favorite genres include J-Pop, Country and Ska. He's also a huge fan of 90s music. Some of his favorite artists are The Bangles, Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Carrie Underwood, Tori Amos and Ace of Base. He won "Girliest Taste in Music" in 2007.

<p>J64 was sitting on top of a hill one day when a small bird flew down and crashed right into his face. After J64 regained consciousness, the bird told him that he had 30 minutes to get ready because he was going to be a Radio PSI DJ. The bird gave him some mystical headphones which when put on his head transformed him into DJ Tansunnami. With his newfound powers, DJ Tansunnami brought the joy and wonder of videogame music to the world. He also brought glory to some, and shame and embarrassment to many with his Name That Videogame Tune game. In 2009, he rebranded himself as DJ Tanner. Kimmy Gibler, however, is still missing. 2010 however, saw Tanner stepping down from active Radio PSI duty.
</p>

<p>
His personal playlist consists almost exclusively of videogame music, but he also enjoys such bands as Civilized Animal, Group X, and The Aquabats. If it's not rap or country, there's a good possibility he'll like it.

He held a slot on Friday nights until he also had to stop due to work.  He returned to Radio PSI, as the host of Friday's Canadian Late Nights in early 2006, but as of August 2006, had to stop due to a combination of being busy, and the broadcasting format not being compatible with his new Macintosh system.  One year later, he's found a method which allows him to broadcast from his Mac, and was brought back to Radio PSI. Dex is now often accompanied by co-hosts DJ Random Object and DJ Adamantium -- with their powers combined with DJ Dex, they are able to provide you with a crushing combo of talk radio and musical mayhem. Also, Radiohead. In 2010, DJ dex left active Radio PSI duty to go to school... to become a radio guy! I KNOW! Expect to hear dex rockin' you in the real world sometime soon!

Mathyz held the "flagship" Saturday spot, and was the leader of the Radio PSI DJ team, eventually passing these roles to DJ Ozztastic and moving on.  Sparked by other interests and a regard to hear a fresh voice on the flagship slot, Mathyz's final show brought out what was at that time a record number of listeners, overloading the Radio PSI Icecast server and causing it to temporarily collapse.

He doesn't broadcast anymore (although he has shown interest in trying again sometime), but his archives will always be around for download, a tribute to a great era of Starmen.net Radio.

<p>Buddy Major Bozo was hired during the Buddy Flood of 2011, along with the future DJs Umbra and Pollyanna, and fellow Buddy Indie Anna. Sadly, life intervened and he disappeared from the radio waves temporarily and later permanently in 2012.
</p>

<p>Buddy Bozo ran the most interactive of Radio PSI's shows, preferring to run games such as Mafia or Apples to Apples and listener activities such as his Theories challenges over playing music. When he does play music, it tends to be video game music, rock, blues rock, blues, soul, and a bit of country and southern music.

<p>In November 2008, Buddy Papercut became the first official member of the Radio PSI team to hail from somewhere other than North America. From the moment the badboy Brit performed his tryout, people, people liked what they heard and knew they were going to be hearing a very different selection of music than they were typically used to on Radio PSI. In addition to his unique playlist, Slice brings some more serious musical talent to the Radio PSI team, so keep your ear to the ground for some for the pumpin' tracks he's apt to cut at any time. After a long absence from Radio PSI active duty, Buddy Papercut was retired from the Radio PSI roster.

Buddy Papercut has a predilection for hip-hop and electronica music.

<p>In August 2007, Buddy Abby Rhode became the second Backup Buddy for Radio PSI.  Heralded from past radio experience, Abby Rhode was a perfect choice, and came strongly recommended by DJ Carparama.  Abby Rhode has plenty of past expertise, including starting out with Carparama at Real Life Radio, DJing at numerous Habbo radio stations, filling in occasionally for Midweek Radio, and even starting his own radio show.  He'd taken a brief hiatus, but eventually made his return, the unfortunately had to take his leave from regular Backup Buddy duties due to work obligations.

<p>
Buddy Abby Rhode brings to the table, an eclectic collection of indie/alternative rock as well as some classics from the 70s/80s. His favorite artists include, The Slip, Band of Horses, The Shins, and Silversun Pickups.

After a long absence from Radio PSI active duty, Buddy Rolanda was retried from the Radio PSI roster.

He brought some wackiness to Tuesday nights. Buddy Duplo was, unfortunately, dismissed from Radio PSI in July, 2009.

<p>
He has a penchant for music related to Sonic the Hedgehog, and if Lego made music, he'd probably listen to that too.
