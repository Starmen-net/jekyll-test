Over the years, Radio PSI has accumulated many supporting members. While not DJs, they are still vital to many programs. These are their stories.

</td>

<tr>
<td>

<p>The Voice is Radio PSI's original co-host, joining DJ Mon early in his run. With his announcer-like sound, The Voice quickly became the voice of Radio PSI as well as co-hosting with DJ Mon. He brought his own flair to the show with his own brand of verbal diarrhea and segments such as the Random Ramble, where he talks about ... something for as close to seven minutes as possible. 
</p>

<p>In early 2011, The Voice left DJ Mon's show for personal reasons and went to explore places uninteresting. There he temporarily joined Team Kobaugh mid-season, until they ceased production. He rejoined DJ Mon just before the start of the 2012-13 season.
</p>

<p>The Voice is known for talking about things at great length and filling dead air with life. ... or at least words. His favourite artists include Alice in Chains, The Alan parsons Project, Nine Inch Nails, and the Sound of His Own Voice.

<font size="6"><b><i>The Dragon</i></b></font><br /><br /><font size="2">(AKA Drago)</font>
</td>

<tr>
<td>

<p>The Dragon first joined DJ Mon and The Voice in martial arts in 2010. When DJ Mon was left without a Voice to call his own, Drago quickly stepped up to make DJ Mon's show much more interesting.
</p>

<p>Being nearly as nerdly as DJ Mon, The Dragon provides a Technical foil to DJ Mon's previous one-sided conversations ... ramblings about technology. He also reigns DJ Mon (or any other part of The Crew in when they start getting a little too "out there".
</p>

<p>The Dragon's favourite bands have yet to be identified, but have likely been fired to a crisp.

</td>

<tr>
<td>

<p>The Highlander joined The Crew shortly after becoming associated with DJ Mon. The only member of The Crew to have their name determined prior to their first appearance, DJ Mon determined that if they didn't already have a name ready, the listeners would have named her The_Girlfriend.
</p>

<p>The Highlander brings a feminine charm to the stream ... when she's not trapped in the Ceramics department. Her favourite bands include Nightwish and 90% of anything Country.

<tr>

<p>Along with The Voice's return to the show, The Noise joined DJ Mon as a refugee from the sunken ship that was the Team Kobaugh program. She hasn't had enough time to leave her mark on the show as yet, but we're confident she and The Sound Byte will carve their own niche soon enough.

</td>

<tr>
<td>

<p>The Random Game has been with DJ Mon sporadically since the beginning. After being a semi-cohost amongst the first few shows DJ Mon did and providing The Video Game Report, TRG left the regular cast for a long period until The Voice left for places uninteresting. TRG has pioneered several segments since his return, spearheading the self-titled "the Random Game" and Half Hour Hero, and helping to start RPG Club.
</p>

<p>More recently, TRG has appeared less frequently and taken on the primary role of being DJ Eggstreme's Personal Troll.

<p>The Riboflavin is the most recent addition to The Crew, having joined to fill the role left by TRG's partial retirement from RPG Club.
</p>

<p>No one quite remembers where The Riboflavin's name came from, but it is currently blamed on The Voice.
