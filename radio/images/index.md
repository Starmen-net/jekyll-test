<p>
Starmen.Net Radio is a long-standing tradition here in the EarthBound Community, one which has been passed from DJ to DJ, from style to style, but with an ever-present thread of good, old-fashioned EarthBound music.  The simple musical ideas of Keiichi Suzuki come to life in original soundtracks, re-issues and remakes from Nintendo, and from the enormous fan-music following of the EarthBound community.  On a weekly basis you can hear many personalities and styles of music right from your computer, and you can enjoy a friendly atmosphere in IRC chat, make requests, communicate with the DJ, and share your music for the entire Internet to hear.
