<p>
Radio PSI is hiring! And now is the time to show you have what it takes to rock faces off and please the listeners with your soothing DJ voice. These deliciously awesome slots will be 6 PM to 8 PM, Eastern time, Monday through Thursday. In addition, Starmen.net will neither archive nor host these shows due to what would be a shockingly large increase in Radio PSI's usage of webspace. The resume to send in is below, but take into account what's to be expected of you as a DJ.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost, you will be expected to be consistant in showing up to do your show at your allotted time slot. Recurring and prolonged absence from doing your show, with no good reason, is cause for being suspended or dismissed as a Radio PSI DJ.
</p>

<p>
You are expected to oblige in accepting and playing requests, though you may use your own judgement in whether the song is appropriate to play on your show. There may be more details to being a DJ you will have to adhere to should you become a member of the Radio PSI team, but that's nothing to worry about for the time being. For now, let's go over the details of the resume.
</p>

<p>
You will be asked all the little nothing stuff like your internet moniker, age, gender, e-mail, and preferred day of the week to do your show, followed by filling out a little self-bio, including why you'd like to be a DJ, and what you hope to bring to the table should you be hired.
</p>

<p>
In addition, you will be asked to include a playlist of all your music (or at least your main music directory), WinAmp can easily make a playlist for you. The reasoning behind this is that we want to see that you have an extensive musical taste, and are able to transition between many genres during a show. People will easily get tired of "Joe Bob Cletus's All-Death Metal Show", or "So-And-So's J-Pop Extravaganza".  If you can't even make your own playlist, there's [b]really[/b] not a whole lot we can help you with.
</p>

<p>
Also, you will be asked to, by your own means, record a demo broadcast (no live broadcasts), 30 minutes long, without help from the current DJs. How you make it is up to you, but we won't help with it. The reasoning behind this is to see to it that you are technologically savvy, and besides, it's just really good beginner experience.
</p>

<p>
Finally, bear in mind these two very important notes:
</p><BR />

1. THIS RESUME IS FOR MONDAY-THURSDAY NIGHTS BETWEEN 6 PM AND 8 PM, EASTERN TIME. IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO DO A SHOW DURING THIS TIME, DON'T SIGN UP!<BR /><BR />

2. THESE SHOWS WILL [b]NOT[/b] BE AUTOMATICALLY ARCHIVED!  STARMEN.NET WILL NEITHER ARCHIVE NOR HOST THESE WEEKDAY SHOWS.  EXPECT TO ARCHIVE AND HOST BY YOUR OWN MEANS.
