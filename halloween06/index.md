The Funfest is an event that used to be held at Starmen.Net multiple times yearly. This year we return with the halloween funfest so get ready to discover your creepy side! (insert spooky SFX here) The Funfest is, basically, a chance for people to be creative and show off their abilities. Anyone may participate, and may submit as many items as they come up with. The idea is for you to do what you're best at and what you have fun doing. For example, artists may want to draw a cool picture or piece of art. People with decent writing skills may want to try their hand at a fanfic.

There are no real limitations to what type of files you submit. Here are some suggestions:<ul><li>Fanfic (.txt .doc .html)</li><li>Poem/Song (.txt .doc .html .wav .mp3)</li><li>Music (.xm .it .mid .mp3 .wav)</li><li>Fanart/Flukes (.gif .jpg)</li><li>Multimedia (Flash, Shockwave, VRML, .avi .mpg)</li></ul>Please keep in mind that these are not the only files that can be submitted. However, all files submitted MUST fit under the theme for the funfest. This Funfest's theme- Halloween. Entries that don't fit the theme at all won't be eligible for any prizes, so don't stray off course!

<li><b>Earthboundalicious</b>: <br/>For the entry that makes us feel warm and fuzzy for that SNES game we love.</li>
</ul>
Each catagory will have 3rd, 2nd, and 1st place, so there'll be 12 winners in all. You can only win one place in the entire game so there'll be 12 unique winners in the game.<ul><li><b>Third Place</b>: Halloween 06 Winner Badge</li><li><b>Second Place</b>: Halloween 06 Winner Badge, Forum Rank, and a @starmen.net email (POP3 or redirect, you choose!)</li><li><b>First Place</b>: <i>Everything in Second Place</i>, a Forum Namevatar/Avatar, 25MB of webspace hosted by Starmen.Net, and a few Earthbound Posters shipped directly to you!</li></ul>
