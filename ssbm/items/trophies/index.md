    <th><b>Barrel Cannon</b></th>
    <td><center>The Barrel Cannons were used in Donkey Kong games as a vital means of transportation, and their explosive nature is used similarly in Super Smash Bros. Melee. On the Kongo Jungle stage, one can catch characters as they fall from the main platform. Careful! The Barrel Cannon rotation may accidentally send you flying off the screen.</center></td>

She earned her wings helping Diddy rescue Donkey Kong from the clutches of King K. Rool. Dixie's amazingly quick and nimble, and she's even able to twirl her ponytail in order to float slowly through the air.</center></td>

    <th><b>Donkey Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>While he now prefers the laid-back jungle lifestyle to construction site mischief, DK is often forced back into action by the Kremling Krew. The great ape is quite fast despite his burly physique, and he keeps his strength up with a steady diet of his favorite food: bananas. His one extravagance (and only piece of clothing) is a monogrammed necktie.</center></td>

The big ape's Headbutt hits so hard that it temporarily buries opponent's in the ground. DK is a lot faster than he looks, and he's lethal in the hands of a master.</center></td>

He can even lift his foe up and make him or her an unwilling traveling companion; if DK grabs you, shake your Control Stick as fast as you can to break his grip. His Spinning Kong covers more lateral distance than vertical, so use it quickly to recover.</center></td>

    <th><img src="Donkey Kong Junior.png" /></th>

DK Jr.'s challenge was to collect the keys to Donkey Kong's cage, all the while dropping fruit on the enemies from high above. He was able to climb faster by using two ivy vines at once. This ape is also quite skilled as kart racing, tennis, and mathematics.</center></td>

    <th><img src="Hammer.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Hammer</b></th>
    <td><center>If you grab the Hammer, you'll run across the screen swinging it back and forth nonstop. In Donkey Kong, Mario used the Hammer in exactly the same fashion. It's an extremely powerful item, but you have no recovery move when carrying it. Every now and then, the mallet head will fall off, and you'll end up completely vulnerable, swinging just the handle.</center></td>

    <th><img src="King K. Rool.png" /></th>
    <th><b>King K. Rool</b></th>
    <td><center>The demented head of the Kremlings and big boss in the Donkey Kong series. K. Rool is a giant, greedy glutton with a serious eye tic. While he fits the evil boss mold nicely, he's just enough of a bumbler to have gained a few fans over the years. His plan to blow up the DK Isles with his Blast-o-Matic shows how unbalanced he is.</center></td>

    <th><b>Klap Trap</b></th>
    <td><center>This low-slung alligator made its first appearance in Donkey Kong Country. You can subdue it by jumping on its back, but it's powerful jaws make it dangerous to approach from the front. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, it swims in the river and sometimes jumps in the Barrel Cannon to stop players from using it.</center></td>

Ness was living a normal life in the suburbs of Onett until a meteor crashed into a nearby mountain and sent him on a wild adventure. Believing in the ultimate powers of wisdom, courage, and friendship, Ness proves that some heroes come in small packages.</center></td>

    <th><img src="Ness [Smash].png" /></th>
    <th><b>Ness [Smash]</b></th>
    <td><center>The key to mastering Ness is controlling his unique midair jump, which makes up for what he lacks in speed. His PK Flash attack may seem weak at first glance, but it grows more powerful the longer you hold down the B Button. To do a lot of damage with PK Fire, try to burn your opponent as many times as possible.</center></td>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Ness [Smash] 2.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Ness [Smash]</b></th>
    <td><center>Ness' mind is his best weapon. PK Thunder is a PSI missile weapon that can be guided using the Control Stick, and if Ness hits himself with it, he turns into a living missile capable of doing massive damage. This move can also be used for recovery. PSI Magnet turns energy missile attacks into health; try out certain Pokémon for stamina replenishment.</center></td>

Ness rescued Paula from the blue-stained clutches of the Happy Happyist cult, and she became integral to his EarthBound adventure. Originally, Ness didn't know either PK Thunder or PK Fire, so Paula probably taught him these techniques.</center></td>

    <td><center>Just one kooky subset of the diverse cast of enemies in EarthBound, these strange creatures are aliens in the employ of Giygas. Variations of the Starman race include Starman, Starman Jr., Starman Deluxe, and Starman Super. They all use PSI powers, but their strength differs depending on the level on which they're found.</center></td>

    <th><b>UFO</b></th>
    <td><center>At the beginning of EarthBound, this flying saucer appears along with the ominous message, "The War Against Giygas!" Adding to the mystery are three more UFOs while fly amok in the skies over Onett; how all of these alien craft are connected is anyone's guess. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, this slippery UFO appears on the Fourside level.</center></td>

    <td><center>Marth is a magnificent swordsman. While his swordplay is faster than that of Link, he lacks power, and his quickness if offset by a marginal endurance. His Shield Breaker gains power the longer it's held. The Dancing Blade combination uses both the Control Stick and the B Button to produce a series of up to four attacks.</center></td>

    <th><img src="Marth [Smash] 2.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Marth [Smash]</b></th>

Marth's Dolphin Slash is fast and powerful, but it leaves him vulnerable upon landing. Marth uses Counter to block a foe's attack and deal a return strike. If you're fighting a Counter-happy Marth, grab him.</center></td>

    <th><img src="Roy [Smash]2.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Roy [Smash]</b></th>
    <td><center>While Roy's moves are well balanced, he's a little on the slow side, and doesn't excel at midair combat. His blade, the Sword of Seals, gives him excellent reach, and makes his Double-Edge Dance slightly different then Marth's Dancing Blade. When it's fully charged, Roy's destructive Flare Blade delivers an instant KO.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Roy [Smash] 2.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Roy [Smash]</b></th>
    <td><center>Roy's blade is different than Marth's: he does the most damage hitting with the center of his sword. So, a fearless advance into the arms of his foe is Roy's best bet. Blazer is a bit slower than Marth's Dolphin Slash, but it's still a mighty attack that sets anyone it strikes aflame. Roy's attack after using Counter differs slightly from Marth's.</center></td>

Falcon uses his Falcon Dive to grab an enemy in midair and fling them away with an explosive blast.

Without this ship, Falcon couldn't prowl the galaxy like a lone wolf: the Blue Falcon is a state-of-the-art machine, but it's only used for F-Zero races.</center></td>
