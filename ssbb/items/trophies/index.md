<tr>
    <th><img src="Animal Crossing Boy.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Animal Crossing Boy</b></th>
    <td><center>The male player character from Animal Crossing. He feels the need to set out on his own and move into town. Chatting with neighbors is a given, but there are a ton of other things to do as well, like collecting furniture, customizing rooms, catching fish and bugs, digging up fossils, etc. He may get bee stung or fall in a pit, but he still has fun.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Sable & Mable.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Sable & Mabel</b></th>
    <td><center>Sisters who run the Able Sisters tailor shop. Mabel's the younger sibling, the one who deals with customers. Her older sister, Sable, sits at the sewing machine in the back of the shop. Sable's shy and will look slightly miffed if you speak to her. If you drop by to chat with her every day, however, she'll gradually warm up and share some stories with you.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Tom Nook.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Tom Nook</b></th>
    <td><center>The owner of the town's only store. He not only helps you find a home when you move in but also gives you a job at his shop. His dream is to expand his business, and as the game progresses, Nook's Cranny becomes Nook 'n' Go, then Nookway, and finally Nookington's. He tends to say "hm" and "yes" quite a bit.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Tortimer.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Tortimer</b></th>
    <td><center>The mayor of the player's town. Usually in his office in the town hall, he emerges on holidays to usher in special festivities. He's a busy fellow who also serves as the record keeper for fishing and bug-catching tournaments. He cuts a very dashing figure in his hat and bow tie. There may be some link between him and Cornimer, who appears at the fall Acorn Festival.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Blathers & Celeste.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Blathers & Celeste</b></th>
    <td><center>Blathers, the elder of this pair, is curator of the town museum, and he's in charge of the insect, art, fish, and fossil displays. He's quite knowledgeable and shares what he knows about donations. He's in charge of donated bugs but hates the majority of them. His younger sis, Celeste, is in charge of the museum's observatory. She's cute even with her feathers ruffled.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Pelly & Phyllis.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Pelly & Phyllis</b></th>
    <td><center>Sisters who work at the town hall, which is open 24 hours a day. The younger Pelly is at the window from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., while Phyllis has the night shift. Pelly's cheerful and polite manner makes her the model of good customer service. Phyllis, however, is snooty and treats everyone with impatience and disdain. That said, she's very efficient at her job.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Pascal.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Pascal</b></th>
    <td><center>A sea otter in a knit cap. He'll spout philosophy seemingly littered with hidden meanings: "People study what can and can't be done, but I think they're missing the point, maaannn." He comes and goes via the sea, diving in with perfect form. It's really up to you to decide whether Pascal's ramblings are the results of deep thought or too much time spent chatting with scallops.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Brewster.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Brewster</b></th>
    <td><center>The proprietor of the Roost, a coffee shop in the basement of the museum. He's very closemouthed, preferring to let the coffee he brews speak for itself. The Roost is also visited from time to time by other residents. If you drop by frequently, Brewster will warm up and begin to engage in conversation.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Dr. Shrunk.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Dr. Shrunk</b></th>
    <td><center>A traveling therapist and part-time comedian who helps people learn to show their emotions. He'll share jokes from his comedy routine--he's got a million of 'em, folks--as a way to teach people how to display reactions like anger, laughter, and the like.</center></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <th><img src="Katrina.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Katrina</b></th>
    <td><center>A mystical fortune-teller who sets up shop outside the town hall at dusk. For a fee of 100 bells, she'll use her tarot cards to tell your daily fortune or to check your compatibility. After telling a fortune, she may slip and say, "Sometimes it is just not meant to be," which is considered taboo among fortune-tellers. This surely means that she is hit or miss.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Blanca.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Blanca</b></th>
    <td><center>A cat whose face is an empty white canvas for you to draw on. After traveling via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, she may appear with a face that someone else drew. Draw a new face, and she'll wander for a bit, then take off for a new town. In Animal Crossing, she would appear on the train between towns. Whether you give her a cute or funny face is up to you.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Cooper & Booker.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Copper & Booker</b></th>
    <td><center>The guards stationed at the town gate through which travelers come and go. Copper, who's on the right, is in charge of traveling via Nintendo WFC, and Booker on the left runs the lost and found. Booker's a cute fellow who's known for his indecisive manner...maybe. Copper's diligent, dedicated, and always ready to lend a helping paw.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Joan.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Joan</b></th>
    <td><center>Investments in town are made by buying and selling turnips. Joan's an elderly boar who comes to town every Sunday morning to trade in these valuable vegetables. She's easily recognizable by her bandana, work pants, and the basket she carries on her back. Her down-to- earth speech endears her to all her customers. She's been in the turnip business for 60 years.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Saharah.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Saharah</b></th>
    <td><center>A trader who comes from afar to deliver merchandise. However, since she always forgets to bring a town map, she needs help making her deliveries. Once you've helped her finish all of her tasks, she'll reward you with a gift. Her unique way of phrasing is part of her exotic charm. It is a fine thing, yes?</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="K.K. Slider.png" /></th>
    <th><b>K.K. Slider</b></th>
    <td><center>A wandering musician. He plays concerts every Saturday night at the Roost in the basement of the museum. All he carries is a single acoustic guitar, but he can play music from all genres. You can request a single tune per concert, and afterward he'll give you a recording of the song to take home. In Animal Crossing: Wild World, his playlist included 70 songs.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Crazy Redd.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Crazy Redd</b></th>
    <td><center>The owner and proprietor of Crazy Redd's Emporium, which sells furniture acquired on the black market. It's said he's famous in the underworld. He drops by once a week and sets up his tent in front of the town hall. His shop's full of rare items, but the prices are high. It's open until midnight, an hour longer than Tom Nook's place, which pleases night players.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Tommy & Timmy Nook.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Tommy & Timmy Nook</b></th>
    <td><center>When Nookway gets remodeled into Nookington's, these twins make their appearance as second-floor salesmen. Tommy's in charge of greeting customers, while Timmy trails along offering support and echoing his older brother's words. Their earnest dedication coupled with their inherent cuteness makes this diminutive duo quite popular.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Katie & Kaitlin.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Katie & Kaitlin</b></th>
    <td><center>A mother and child who've gotten separated. After you've gone to visit a friend's town, you'll find either Kaitlin, the mom, or Katie, the wayward kitten, in your town. Both will tell you where they came from, and it's then your duty to travel to that town to reunite the family. Once you do, the player whose town Katie was in will get a letter of thanks and a present.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Wendell.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Wendell</b></th>
    <td><center>A famous painter who wanders about with a large rucksack on his back. When he arrives in town, he's so hungry he can barely stand. While you think it's probably a good idea to give him something to eat, it's hard to figure out what that should be. That being said, he looks really hungry and would likely devour anything given to him.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Kapp'n.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Kapp'n</b></th>
    <td><center>A taxi driver in Animal Crossing: Wild World who drives the player into town for the first time. His questions determine the appearance of the player and sometimes come off as a bit rude. In the original Animal Crossing, you could travel to an island by boat. Kapp'n was the guide who ferried the player to that island and is remembered for his unique speech and salty songs.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Gulliver.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Gulliver</b></th>
    <td><center>An astronaut who travels the galaxy in a UFO. Just as he's returning to his hometown, he passes over your village. You can shoot down his UFO with a slingshot. If you do, Gulliver will ask you to recover the parts of his ship that have been scattered about the land.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Mr. Resetti (Feet).png" /></th>
    <th><b>Mr. Resetti (Feet)</b></th>
    <td><center>A character who normally appears from underground to lecture the player. However, he is not always underground--in Animal Crossing: Wild World, he can be found sipping coffee at the Roost if you go at a certain time on a certain day. In the Japanese-only "e+" version, he works at a so-called "Resetti Observation Center" where you can pop in for a visit.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Pitfall.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Pitfall</b></th>
    <td><center>A tricky little item you can bury. Any player who passes over it will drop into a hole. If you land in a pitfall, move the Control Stick quickly back and forth to escape, because until you do, you're completely defenseless. In Animal Crossing, this item also dropped passersby into holes. It was a thrill to bury one and wait for a visiting pal to stumble across it.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Mr. Resetti.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Mr. Resetti</b></th>
    <td><center>A mole wearing a hard hat who'll show up when you restart your game without having saved. He pops up and lets you know in no uncertain terms the importance of saving your game. The problem is, his speeches are entertaining enough to warrant breaking the rules at least once. In Animal Crossing, his brother Don appears too. He's the polar opposite of his sibling.</center></td>

    <col width="800px" />
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Donkey Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Donkey Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>A carefree jungle dweller with the charisma of a natural leader. He keeps busy by foiling the plans of the Kremlings and their boss, King K. Rool. As his physique suggests, this ape is a powerhouse. He's got speed to match too, and his love for bananas is second to none. His famous necktie is adorned with his initials, DK.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Konga Beat.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Konga Beat</b></th>
    <td><center>DK about to go to town with some bongos! His performance is so magnificent and upbeat that it creates damage-inducing sound waves. Press the buttons in time to the music, and the sound waves may grow stronger. DK's invulnerable when launching this attack, but he's also immobile, so be careful using it on scrolling stages.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Diddy Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Diddy Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>Donkey Kong's little buddy. He's famous for his quickness and his long tail. He usually plays second banana to DK, but he teamed up with his girlfriend, Dixie, to rescue DK when he got captured. He's spent some time playing music and competing in races, and he's also an expert at using barrels.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Rocketbarrel Barrage.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Rocketbarrel Barrage</b></th>
    <td><center>Diddy Kong's Final Smash. Equipping his rocketbarrels and dual peanut popguns, Diddy can fly around attacking opponents in rapid-fire fashion. He can tilt the barrel jets left or right to control his flight and shoot peanuts straight down, too. This is a technique that tests one's ability to control both movement and attack direction.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Hammer.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Hammer</b></th>
    <td><center>An item that, once grabbed, makes you swing nonstop. It's a powerful attack item that does terrific damage and sends opponents sailing. Once in a great while, the hammer's head will fall off, leaving you nothing but the handle. Of course, you can't tell whether the head is securely fastened just by looking. Hammerheads that fall off can be picked up and thrown as weapons.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Spring.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Spring</b></th>
    <td><center>An item used to assist jumping. Jump on it, and it will send you bounding sky-high. You can also toss enemies onto it. It originally appeared in the second stage of Donkey Kong Jr., where it was used as a shortcut to leap to a distant platform. It resembles the bouncing projectiles that appeared in Donkey Kong, but those are said to be actually jacks, not springs.</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Dixie Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Dixie Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>Diddy Kong's cutie of a girlfriend with an adorable blond ponytail. That ponytail is hardly for show--it helps propel her through the air for extended hang time and is indispensable for spin-attacking enemies and lifting barrels. Watch out--Dixie packs more power than you might imagine!</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Funky Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Funky Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>A sunglassed surfer and friend of the Kongs. Funky Kong is indeed funky, from his looks to his lingo. Funky provides different services to the Kong throughout the different games, be it a barrel-transport system or ammunations expertise. He may have tired of business dealings, as he's been a barrel-race participant more recently.</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Candy Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Candy Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>Donkey Kong's rumored girlfriend--although nobody is quite sure if the rumor is true. With Candy's looks and elegance, she would be quite the catch. There's a mode in Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast where Donkey Kong must compete according to Candy's requests. Candy is also known to have run a music shop.</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Lanky Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Lanky Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>One of the more eccentric Kong friends. He's probably the most laid back of the Kongs and has many comical expressions and mannerisms. He uses his long arms to take out baddies and can walk on his hands to climb steep slopes. Sweet! In the recent game Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast, Lanky appears for the first time in years.</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Wrinkly Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Wrinkly Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>The wife of Cranky Kong. Wrinkly first appeared as director of Kong Kollege, where she provided game hints. Did you know King K. Rool was also a student of hers? After her passing, she appeared in Donkey Kong 64 as a ghost, where again... she provided hints.</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Rambi.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Rambi</b></th>
    <td><center>A rhino friend who appears to help the Kongs in their adventures... from a wooden box, even! His destructive power lets his rider plow through enemies and super-dash to break through walls and other obstacles. Know what that means? It means uncovering more hidden bananas and life balloons!</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Enguarde.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Enguarde</b></th>
    <td><center>A swordfish animal buddy. Enguarde always appears on water levels where he can loyally help Donkey Kong get around. Much appreciated, right, DK? Complementing his cute, round eyes, Enguarde's pointed bill proves to be a powerful weapon. One thrust from it will easily down most underwater opponents.</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Kritter.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Kritter</b></th>
    <td><center>A member of the Kremlings. Led by King K. Rool, Kritters are the grunts of the army. They appear frequently in Donkey Kong Country in green, purple, blue, and other color variations--the blue ones will jump after Donkey Kong. Kritters also appear in Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast, pounding those barrels in pursuit of Donkey Kong.</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Tiny Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Tiny Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>A cute, young Kong in pigtails, a knit cap, and jumbo earrings. In Donkey Kong 64, she could extend her airtime after jumps and fly through the air with helicopter hair. Also a participant in Barrel Blast, her high speed is on full display.</center></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Cranky Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Cranky Kong</b></th>
    <td><center>A village chief and bitter old codger. Cranky uses his extensive knowledge and wisdom to provide helpful hints. He has also made appearances in a white lab coat as a potion-dealing chemist, granting the Kongs special abilities. Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast features Cranky as a playable character for the first time.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Squitter.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Squitter</b></th>
    <td><center>A spider friend of the Kongs. Squitter features a patchy pattern and a fancy sneaker on each foot. With Diddy on board, Squitter will assist by spewing out webs that serve as projectile weapons or temporary platforms. These platforms can be used to access otherwise unreachable areas.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Expresso.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Expresso</b></th>
    <td><center>An ostrich friend with sneakers on both feet. Riding Expresso allows for high-speed dashing. As an ostrich, Expresso can't fly, but rapid button pressing can put extra distance on his jumps. This can be used to help Donkey Kong reach distant places.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="King K. Rool.png" /></th>
    <th><b>King K. Rool</b></th>
    <td><center>The supreme commander of the Kremling Krew. King K. Rool steals bananas from Donkey Kong and ends up kidnapping Diddy Kong. He is so good at playing dead that sometimes the credits even roll as he lies there, feigning defeat. His brother, Kaptain K. Rool, made an appearance in the game Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Kass.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Kass</b></th>
    <td><center>A precocious Kremling child. Kass is an ever-so-slightly malicious girl who wants to grow up ever so much. Her trademark look is a camisole and jumbo ribbon. She exhibits top-of-the-line cornering and acceleration but has close to the lowest top speed of all the characters in Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast. She attacks with spin moves.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Kip.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Kip</b></th>
    <td><center>The little brat of the Kremlings and a naughty trickster. Kip is quick and corners as well as anyone, but his top speed is quite low. He sports a tough look with his black T-shirt and spiked wristbands--just the look he needs to prove he's one bad little dude. His attack is a double-legged kick.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Kalypso.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Kalypso</b></th>
    <td><center>A cool beauty with chic makeup and groovy hair. Kalypso combines enough acceleration to break free from the pack with a respectable top speed. Her cornering is a bit weak, but good players should be able to overcome this. Her claw attack will get you...if her high-pitched laugh doesn't.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Kludge.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Kludge</b></th>
    <td><center>A member of the Kremling Krew making his first appearance in Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast. His less-than-average acceleration and weak cornering are offset by an impressive top speed. Kludge's relation to the physically fit blue Krunchas and Krumples of the Kremling forces is still unknown.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Helibird.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Helibird</b></th>
    <td><center>A bird that helps Donkey Kong by carrying him with its feet and flying up to higher areas. These beautiful birds feature big, decorated wings and unique coloring. A certain Strawberry Kingdom is home to a Helibird nest populated only by Helibirds.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Turret Tusk.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Turret Tusk</b></th>
    <td><center>A boss enshrined upon a cliff in the Apple Kingdom. This creature gathers its breath and launches bombs from its nose. The trick is to throw pineapple-shaped bombs into its nose when it's inhaling to blow it up from the inside. For all its austerity, the Turret Tusk is actually quite stupid.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Xananab.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Xananab</b></th>
    <td><center>A banana alien that shows up as Donkey Kong and company are enjoying a relaxing vacation on the beach. Traveling by spaceship from their banana planet, they mistake the Kongs for enemies and attack. As such, the Kongs retaliate by destroying their ship. To top it off, their superpowerful crystal banana is stolen by the Kremlings.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Peanut Popgun.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Peanut Popgun</b></th>
    <td><center>A unique firearm that only Diddy Kong can use. It's made of a chunk of wood and shoots peanuts. In Donkey Kong 64, he carried two pistols and could fire two shots at a time. In Smash Bros., the peanut ammo bursts out of its shells when fired. The peanuts can be grabbed and eaten to reduce damage. The longer the gun is charged before firing, the faster the peanuts fly.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Rocketbarrel Pack.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Rocketbarrel Pack</b></th>
    <td><center>An item that looks like regular barrels but becomes a rocket-powered jet pack when Diddy Kong straps them on his back. It's a convenient gadget to have when adventuring, but for whatever reason, Diddy also uses it when playing tennis and basketball. The moves he can pull off with the rocketbarrel pack are so cool that they're almost not fair. Almost.</center></td>

    <th><img src="Ike.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Ike</b></th>
    <td><center>A member of Crimea's top fighting force, the Greil Mercenaries. He's a man of few words whose blunt manner gives the impression that he's uncaring, but he's actually a passionate hero. He was crucial to the reconstruction of Crimea. In Radiant Dawn, he continues to show his deep sense of honor and leads the Greil Mercenaries to the aid of the Laguz Alliance.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Great Aether.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Great Aether</b></th>
    <td><center>Ike's Final Smash—a powered-up version of his signature move, Aether. Ike faces a foe and swings his sword up for a hit, then tosses his sword into the air, performs multiple nasty strikes, and finally unleashes a mighty overhand blow to send his opponent plummeting down. It's a very impressive sight, but if Ike misses with the first upward swing, he can't use the move.</center></td>
