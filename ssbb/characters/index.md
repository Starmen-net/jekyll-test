<br /><br />
Bowser is a heavyweight character. He doesn’t fly very far when hit, but this makes is recovering difficult. These together make him possible to be KOed above 75%. He is also fairly slow with some of his attacks. He makes up for this with raw power and a versatile array of moves and abilities that make use of his large size.

He may be much smaller than Donkey Kong, but he's much more nimble, and can still pack a punch with his peanut popgun!
<br /><br />
Diddy Kong is a medium weight character who can be KO’ed around 75%. He hits surprisingly hard and has many disruptive attacks on the opponent. He is a fairly close range character, though he does have long range weapons. He is adept at both ground and air, but excels in his ground attacks the best. He can also wall cling and jump off of them for a bit of dodging and recovery ability too.

DK, Donkey Kong is here!</i> <br />While his father used to rival Mario himself, Donkey Kong has begun adventures of his own. This stubborn gorilla is often fending off baddies from his own lands, with strength rivaling Bowser!
<br /><br />
Donkey Kong is a very heavy character who hits hard and has some surprisingly fast attacks. He has no ranged abilities and recovery is a bit of a problem for him. He can be KO’ed around 100% damage. DK is a mostly ground based character since his throws and smash attacks are very good. However, he does have two spiking attacks.

He is difficult to use, due to a complete lack of projectile attacks and multi-hit attacks. However, he can deal extremely high damage with moves like Warlock Punch. He’s a clone of Captain Falco, although not as much as in Melee, and very different in use. You can cancel his wizard foot and create a lagless transition to other techniques by apparently rolling to the edge of a stage, then wizard footing towards the middle, which strangely behaves as though he had footed himself off the ledge and allows some aerial techniques or his choke attack to be started sooner.

You only control one of them, usually Popo, but both will attack in unison. Nana is controlled by the cpu, but tries to mimic your inputs. If you can desynchronize them from each other, it’s as though you’re attacking with two separate characters rather than a single character which hits twice for every attack. Since only one of them can grab at once, together, they can initiate chain grabs that are inescapable in the hands of a good player. They have a lot of advantage when using items, since not only will you grab both items, denying them from opponents, but you’ll use them both at once too. Only the climber you control will actually take damage, but Nana can be knocked out. If she is, Popo will become fairly weak with only himself attacking, plus his special moves will be weakened greatly. They are lightweight so they can be KOed around 75% by strong hits.

King Dedede's the self-proclaimed King of Dream Land, and a bit of a bully, but he's been softening up a bit and has often helped Kirby's adventures more than try and stop him.

<br /><br />
Link is a heavy character now that he wears chainmail in Brawl. His recovery and jump height have been severely limited since Melee, making link a much more difficult character to play. Though his extra weight (about that of Captain Falcon) allows him to not get knocked as far, he will have a tough time getting back to the stage. Overall, he hits hard and has many projectile attacks to keep opponents at bay. He can be KOed around 60% damage, though most of the time, his trajectory will be low, so position yourself near a low wall if you can. Also remember that by standing still, many projectiles can be blocked by Link’s shield if you’re not holding an item.

He may have be a bit teary at times, but Lucas knows how to overcome trials and uses his ability to love to save the world.
<br /><br />
Lucas is a lightweight character. He can easily be KO’ed by an opponent if he is above 60 percent damage. Some of his best attacks are also slow to hit and leave him very open to opponents. However, Lucas’ attacks are some of the most powerful in the game and he is a very versatile character, having a way to recover from damage, deflect attacks, recover from great distances and he can even turn himself into a projectile. His attacks excel at aerial abilities due to his very effective second jump. His best smash attack is upwards, so this helps him accumulate damage on opponents and follow up with his good aerial techniques.

Unlike Mario, Luigi possesses a different style and unique abilities his brother lacks. Sure, he doesn't regularly save the princess like Mario, but he goes on his own misadventures from time to time.
<br /><br />
Starting as an almost perfect clone of Mario in the Smash Bros series, Luigi has now evolved into a completely different character with very unique abilities and playstyles. He is fairly light, or rather, very floaty. He flies far when hit, falls slowly and has very versatile recovery techniques. He does not have a way to deflect projectiles like Mario does though. Overall, he is a very air based character, excelling in manoeuvring through the battlefield. He is easily KO-able at 75% damage or so.

His days of carpentry and plumbing are over and he regularly spends his days saving the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and facing his rivals in a variety of sports games.

Mario is THE overall character in terms of speed, movement and abilities. He has a few unique tricks but for the most part, he’s average. His abilities include a couple useful projectile attacks, A deflection ability, some useful grabs and a very good final smash. For recovery, he has only the standard second jump and a mediocre up b attack jump. His weight makes him sturdy enough to not be KO’ed until about 75% damage. Mario is also capable of wall jumping, which lets him recover from falls slightly better than others on some stages and opens up a lot of useful techniques to jump up the wall and hit the opponent on the way up.

Marth is a good character when it comes to combos, and though he isn’t a power master, he makes up for the damage for both ground and aerial combos. He is good with dodging opponents combos and has a good range when it comes to his sword. However, his throws are poor.

Her hits are moderately powerful, though getting them to combo together takes a bit of work. She has a good Samus has a great ranged game, with two ranged attacks as well as bomb dropping. Her falling speed is fairly slow, allowing for a good aerial game. Samus’ biggest weakness is her lack of effective finishing moves.

Yoshi is a medium weight character who can be KO’ed around 75%. His hits are moderately weak, but he has great aerial attacks. He has a variety of abilities to control his opponents and has good area denial with his ranged eggs. Unfortunately though his second jump is very good, he only has the two jumps. His shield is unique in that it does not get smaller as it is used and always covers his whole body.

        <td><center><a name="zelda"><img class="picleft" src="/ssbb/characters/chars/Zelda.png" width="199.5" height="299.5" /></a></center></td><td>Zelda is the Princess of Hyrule, and despite often being captured by Ganon, similar to Peach, don't be fooled! Her magical abilities are very powerful, being able to send telepathic messages and shoot arrows of light. She plays a key role in stopping Ganon, too!<br /><br />Zelda and Sheik are two characters in one. Together, they are most like Pokemon Trainer in that you can change form whenever needed, as opposed to Samus who can only transform upon using a final smash. This character guide is in two parts due to the vastly different styles and movesets of each form. <br />
Dispite her height, Zelda is a lightweight character. She has rather slow speed, but powerful magic based attacks. She has a non-reflectable projectile attack, a deflection move, spiking capability, excellent recovery and powerful damage output. She can be KOed around 65%.

Power suit Samus is the default form unless you hold the R button before the stage select screen loads. Zero Suit Samus (Zss for short in this guide) is quite a bit lighter once her armour falls off, though she is faster and has very good combo abilities. Like Samus, the Links, Sheik, Lucas, etc. Zss has a tether grab that unlike those mentioned characters, cannot be used to latch onto ledges. She has great KOing moves, many recovery options, great jumping ability for aerial moves, Longer ranged smash attacks with a high priority over other moves, and even if she starts the match without her power suit, Zss gets the parts of the suit to throw at opponents as soon as the match begins. The only thing Zss seems to lack is defense, since she has a fairly tall model, no extra shield moves and can be KOed as low as ****
