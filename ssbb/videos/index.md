<h3>
Trailer 1 - E3 (May 2006)</h3><br />
<p>This is the first trailer shown for the game. It revealed the characters Mario, Link, Kirby, Pikachu, Meta-knight, Pit, Samus, Zero-suit Samus, Wario, and Snake, as well as some new stages associated with those characters. Additionally, the game's theme song was introduced in this trailer.</p>

Trailer 2 - Nintendo World (Nov 2006)</h3><br />
<p>The second trailer revealed some more footage straight from the game. At the end of the trailer, Fox and his stage, Lylat Cruise, were revealed (although the name of his stage was later confirmed in a smashbros.com update).</p>

<h3>   	
Nintendo conference (Wednesday, October 10th, 2007)</h3><br />
<p>Finally, a new lengthy trailer! We get to see a lot more gameplay footage, including the new damage counters in action. I could go in-depth about what happens in each scene, but you're better off watching it for yourself. We can see Fox grab a Smash Ball and blow stuff up with his tank, and we can also see a few moments of Lucas in action; although it's nothing spectacular, unfortunately. It ends with every character doing (presumably) their taunt, including Lucas! </p>
