<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/movies/movie01.html"><b>Trailer 1 - E3 (May 2006) - 2:30</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer1.jpg" title="Trailer 1" border="0" /></a><br />
This is the first trailer shown for the game. It revealed the characters Mario, Link, Kirby, Pikachu, Meta-knight, Pit, Samus, Zero-suit Samus, Wario, and Snake, as well as some new stages associated with those characters. Additionally, the game's theme song was introduced in this trailer.<br />
<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/movies/movie070712a.html?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=290&width=420"><b>Trailer 3 - E3 (July 2007) - 0:15</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer3.jpg" title="Trailer 3" border="0" /></a><br />
Although very short, this footage shows Fox using the Cracker Launcher item, Pikachu's Final Smash, and a very brief moment of Donkey Kong, thus confirming him as a playable character.<br />

<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_uk/movies/movie070821a.html?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=290&width=420"><b>Movie clip - Smashbros.com updates (Tuesday, August 21st, 2007) - 0:47</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer5.jpg" title="Movie clip" border="0" /></a><br />
An extension of the previous movie clip, this one really displays the intensity of evil presence in Brawl. The <b>Subspace Army</b>'s leader, the Ancient Minister (pictured), swoops down and drops a mechanical ball that two R.O.B.s operate. It opens up and begins to count down from three minutes, indicating that it's probably a bomb. Mario gets blasted into the distance by a Bullet Bill, Peach and Zelda get trapped in cages, and Kirby is left to take on a massive... <i>Petey Piranha.</i> Scary.<br /><br /><br />

<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_uk/movies/movie071002d.html?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=355&width=532"><b>Movie clip - Snake joins the Brawl! (Tuesday, October 2nd, 2007) - 1:19</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer7.jpg" title="Movie clip" border="0" /></a><br />
This clip begins with a codec transmission involving Snake. After a brief conversation, Snake shows off his various fighting moves. He can throw grenades, bury explosive things in the ground, hide under a box, and fly with a floating donut. The clip confirms the bubble-shield's return prematurely.<br /><br /><br />

<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_uk/movies/movie071010a.html?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=390&width=532"><b>Movie clip - Sonic joins the Brawl! (Wednesday, October 10th, 2007) - 0:55</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer9.jpg" title="Movie clip" border="0" /></a><br />
Behold: Sonic! The crazy speculation is true, and the Sega fanboy's dream has been granted. Sonic shows off his immense speed and awesome fighting style in this video. Be sure to watch the whole thing, because at the end, you can catch a glimpse of Sonic turning into his golden alternate form, Super Sonic!<br /><br /><br />

<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/movies/movie02.html"><b>Trailer 2 - Nintendo World (Nov 2006) - 2:37</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer2.jpg" title="Trailer 2" border="0" /></a><br />
The second trailer revealed some more footage straight from the game. At the end of the trailer, Fox and his stage, Lylat Cruise, were revealed (although the name of his stage was later confirmed in a smashbros.com update).<br />

<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/movies/movie070803a.html?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=290&width=420"><b>Movie clip - Smashbros.com updates (Friday, August 3rd, 2007) - 0:42</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer4.JPG" title="Movie clip" border="0" /></a><br />
This isn't a trailer, but it shows off some footage from the new Adventure Mode in Brawl called <b>The Subspace Emissary</b>. This mode allows for customized one-player games, so stay tuned for any MOTHER info related to this! The video shows Mario and Kirby in a stadium being approached by the Haliberd (Meta-knight's airship) which drops some purple evil stuff, which then transform into a bunch of punchbags with arms. Zelda and Peach swoop down from the sky to save the day. No kidding.<br /><br /><br />

<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_uk/movies/movie070903a.html?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=290&width=420"><b>Movie clip - Pit's Descent (Monday, September 3rd, 2007) - 0:56</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer6.jpg" title="Movie clip" border="0" /></a><br />
The clip shows Pit in a temple, witnessing the Subspace stadium being engulfed in a dark cloud of energy. He consults Palutenia, who give him his double-bladed sword. He runs to the pier, an opening behind him comes forth, and he swiftly takes a fall and begins his descent towards the battle.<br />

<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_uk/movies/movie071010b.html?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=320&width=420"><b>Trailer 4 - Nintendo conference (Wednesday, October 10th, 2007) - 1:08</b><br />
<img src="/ssbb/screenshots/trailer8.jpg" title="Trailer 4" border="0" /></a><br />
Finally, a new lengthy trailer! We get to see a lot more gameplay footage, including the new damage counters in action. I could go in-depth about what happens in each scene, but you're better off watching it for yourself. We can see Fox grab a Smash Ball and blow stuff up with his tank, and we can also see a few moments of Lucas in action; although it's nothing spectacular, unfortunately. It ends with every character doing (presumably) their taunt, including Lucas! Check it out quick.<br />You might notice the "COMING SOON" banner at the end of the video. Indeed, the December 3rd North American release date has been changed to "TBD" ("to be dated"), so it'd possible that Brawl could experience some delays. Even the Japanese site bumped the date to January 24th. Stay tuned for the latest information.<br />
