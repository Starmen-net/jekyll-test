Brawl is the third installment of Nintendo's massively popular franchise and offers a whole slew of new features this time around. Released on the Nintendo Wii in March of 2008, Brawl offered players with a roster of <i>37</i> different characters and <i>41</i> stages! Not only do a number of old characters make a return, but there are several popular newcomers as well, such as Mario's rival, Sonic and Konami's very own Snake. However, probably the most thrilling is the lesser-known, but absolutely beloved by fans, Mother 3's very own Lucas! Mr. Saturn returns as an item, Jeff appears as a character-assisting item, and even New Pork City is a new stage! Never before has a Smash game offered so much content and this title offers quite a bit to the Mother-series fans.

This mode is filled with alternate routes, cut-scenes, and allows the characters to interact in a way like never before! There are many different bosses to encounter from Nintendo's franchises, including the big boss himself, King Porky!
<br /><br />
This section of the site is devoted to Brawl, namely the Mother-related info, but we'll be including other franchises as well! With this game so chalk full of things, we're still working on updating it at the time, but do still take a look!</p>
