With Smash Bros. Brawl coming to the Wii, the online capabilities and the game's features will allow people to game together online. With this, Starmen.Net will have tournaments with this great game to further unite the gamers of the community. Prizes and much more will be given out when this goes down. stay tuned and make sure to be here when Brawl hits store and the interweb soon after!
