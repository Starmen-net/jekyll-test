And that brings us to Mother 3.

We announced that it was being worked on, but I don't feel it would be a good idea to talk about it yet. If I were to say something, it would wind up set in stone and take away from our creative freedom.

I'm sure many people would like to ask, but is it also because of trade secrets?

No, that's not it. You know how when a married couple finds out the woman is pregnant they don't say anything until they're absolutely sure about it? I guess it's a bit like that. A lot of people are looking forward to it, but I'm sure they're also uneasy since it was cancelled once before. So if I were to say too much, it would probably panic a lot of people, us included. It's a fact that we're working on it, and a fact that it's coming along. (laugh)

Are you going to show it off only after it's finished?
<BR /><BR />

<B>Itoi:</B>
</TD>
<TD>
I'd like to do something like that. Imagining stuff while waiting for a game is another part of the game experience. With Mother 1+2, people are saying how glad they are that the announcement came after it was done. I'd like to do something along those lines.

So you're saying to forget "3" for now?
<BR /><BR />

</TD>
<TD>
Yes! Please! Just know that it's being developed not as a movie or a novel but as a GameBoy Advance game. The rest you can forget. I think it's best for the development team to have the time to be able to make things by trial and error; it's not something you make on a conveyor belt in a factory. For better or for worse, it's done by hand, so I think it's vital that they have room to work out any kinks or other problems.

It was cancelled once before; can we assume you're being more cautious this time around?
<BR /><BR />

<TD align="right" valign="top">
<B>Itoi:</B>
</TD>
<TD>
Yes, of course. I don't want to put too much pressure on the team. When the release date approaches, I'd like them to think, "Whew, all done!" It's like in baseball. It's common for a rookie pitcher to quietly stay in the farm to gather strength, and then one day finally step onto the mound. I'd like to do something like that here.
<BR /><BR />

<TR>
<TD align="right" valign="top">
<B>Hobonichi:</B>
</TD>
<TD>
Understood. If anything big happens, please let us know. Until then, we'll try to forget the number 3.

Whoops, I seem to have forgotten it myself. (laugh)

For now, there's a bit of time until "1+2", and I plan to enjoy that to my heart's content. Thank you very much.
<BR /><BR />

<TD>
Not at all. I'm thankful that I wasn't able to brag too much.

No, not at all.

No, no, not at all. There'll be no end to this, so let's turn the tape off. Thank you very much to the people reading this!

Don't end the interview yet! I still want to discuss Mother 1+2 for the last part. Everyone's looking forward to it.
