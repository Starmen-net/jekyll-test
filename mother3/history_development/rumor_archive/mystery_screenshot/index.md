<h3>The Screenshot</h3>
<br /><br />
<p>During November of 2004, a mysterious screenshot appeared on the Japanese side of the Internet. The screenshot bore a striking resemblance to the previous two MOTHER(EarthBound) games, especially the first.  The menu was basically a replication of MOTHER's. There were many other specific similarities. It is unknown where this screenshot originated. It is thought to be some sort of hoax or fan-made game, but its source was never verified.</p>

<h3>The House</h3>
<br /><br />
<p>The building is very similar to buildings found in MOTHER, though the angle is slightly different.

<h3>The Girl</h3>
<br /><br />
<p>This girl looks very much like the girl picking mushrooms in Peaceful Rest Valley in MOTHER 2(EarthBound).
