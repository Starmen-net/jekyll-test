Shortly after Shigesato Itoi wrote about going to Kichijoji, where Brownie Brown is located, to work on "it" a flash animation appeared on Brownie Brown's website that featured a very Mother/Earthbound-like battle sequence. Four of Brownie Brown's staff members, in the likenesses of the chosen four, battled the N-Dude, a caped villain in a Darth Vader helmet. Memorable lines from Mother 2's battles were used and in the end, it featured a Game Over screen like Mother 2's where a spotlight shines over the collapsed main character.<BR /><BR />
The battle animation is featured on the fifth page in a section of Brownie Brown's website simply titled "Project B." Numerous pages of project B refer to the Nintendo DS as well as Magical Vacation DS ~The Greatest Hypnotist~.<BR /><BR />
This little animation got the attention of Edge Magazine, which featured a blurb about it that also mentioned starmen.net.
