With all the excitement about MOTHER 3's release, there were many rumors and weird ideas floating around about the game. This page is meant to debunk this false information.

<B>RUMOR:</B> Shigesato Itoi said several times that MOTHER 3 for Game Boy Advance would have a completely different story than the story he had written for MOTHER 3/EarthBound 64 for the Nintendo 64.

<BR /><BR />
<B>FACT:</B> Itoi never said this. He was always careful with his words, but he never clearly stated that the two games' stories would be completely different. Because of his carefully-vague wording, many fans mistook his comments to mean that the games would be completely different. This is probably the most widespread of all the false MOTHER 3 rumors.
<BR /><BR />
It appears that MOTHER 3 for GBA is for the most part a portable version of the canceled Nintendo 64 Mother 3. There may have been elements changed, added, or removed, but the majority of the game seems to be unchanged when compared to what we've seen of the older version of the game.

<B>RUMOR:</B> MOTHER3.com takes you to Nintendo of America's site. This can only mean Nintendo is planning to translate the game into English!<BR /><BR />
<B>FACT:</B> Nintendo of America registered that domain in 1999, presumably to keep cyber-squatters from taking it. It has redirected to NOA's site ever since. This is nothing new, and really doesn't mean anything.

<B>RUMOR:</B> MOTHER 3 is being released on 4/20 because Itoi likes drugs or because it's Hitler's birthday! Groovy!

<BR /><BR />
<B>FACT:</B> MOTHER 3 is being released on 4/20 because it's during one of the busiest shopping weeks in Japan. The very next week is known as "<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_%28Japan%29">Golden Week</A>", which is a week-long vacation for pretty much everyone throughout Japan. Many other games are being released on 4/20 in Japan, including:
<UL>
  <LI>Final Fantasy XI: Aht Urhgan no Hihou</LI>
  <LI>Final Fantasy XI: All-In-One Pack 2006</LI>
  <LI>Dragon Quest: Shounen Yangus no Fushigi na Daibouken</LI>
  <LI>Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai</LI>
  <LI>Soleil Puzzle Douwa Oukoku</LI>
  <LI>Tsubasa Chronicle Vol. 2</LI>
  <LI>Zoo Tycoon: Doubutsuen o Tsukurou!</LI>
  <LI>Iris (2800 Collection)</LI>
  <LI>Natsuyume Yobanashi (2800 Collection)</LI>
  <LI>Omoi no Kakera: Close to (2800 Collection)</LI>
  <LI>Ookami</LI>
  <LI>Rakugaki Oukoku 2 (Taito Best)</LI>
  <LI>Shooting Love: Trizeal</LI>
  <LI>Minna no Chizu</LI>
  <LI>Myst</LI>
  <LI>Ninety-Nine Nights</LI>
</UL>

Clearly, these aren't all drug-related either. The week before Golden Week is a prime week for shopping since many stores and businesses shut down during Golden Week itself.

<BR /><BR />
As for purposely trying to coincide it with Hitler's birthday... that's just dumb.

<B>RUMOR:</B> Itoi planned to never release any screenshots of MOTHER 3 prior to the game's release in Japan. This rumor also mentioned that the game's packaging itself wouldn't have any screenshots either!

<BR /><BR />
<B>FACT:</B> This piece of false information was the result of the imagination of an Insert Credit author known for making up little lies on a regular basis. The author later admitted on the Starmen.Net forums to making this up. What's more, Itoi unveiled three screenshots only a matter of days later.

<B>RUMOR:</B> The MOTHER 3 screenshots that Itoi has released are from a very early version of MOTHER 3 and are probably going to change a lot by the final version.

<BR /><BR />
<B>FACT:</B> The MOTHER 3 screenshots are from a practically-finished version of the game. People get the wrong idea from Itoi's disclaimer that these screenshots are from an unfinished version of the game. The fact is that the game probably won't be 100% final until shortly before the game's release in Japan, so he's just being cautious with what he says and does. It's very unlikely that any character designs, which are created much earlier in the game-making process, will be making any drastic changes at the very last minute during the debugging phase.

<B>RUMOR:</B> Flint, the cowboy seen in some of the screenshots, is the older version of Lucas, the blonde-haired kid, in some of the other screenshots.
<BR /><BR />
<B>FACT:</B> He's not.
