<br /><br />

The story begins in Onett, a small town in Eagleland, in the year 199X.

<br /><br />

A loud noise awakens Ness. Upon reaching the top of the hill to investigate, he is informed that it was caused by a meteorite. Upon returning home, Ness goes back to sleep, only to be reawakened by another noise -- Pokey knocking on the door. Claiming that he took his younger brother Picky to look at the meteorite but ended up separated from him, he convinces Ness to help him find Picky.

<br /><br />

As the two head home after finding Picky, they are interrupted by an insect-like being named Buzz Buzz. He, claiming to have come from ten years in the future, informs Ness and his party of an alien threat -- Giygas. He explains that, in the future he came from, Giygas has already succeeded, but also asserts that this eventuality could be prevented if action were to be taken in the present. Referring to two legends, he asserts that Ness is one of the ones chosen to stop Giygas.

<br /><br />

The group returns to Pokey’s house, fighting off the Starman Junior -- an assassin hired by Giygas to eliminate Buzz Buzz -- on the way. Aloysius Minch, Pokey and Picky’s father, punishes his sons, angry at them for being outside this late. Lardna, their mother, in addition, mistakes Buzz Buzz for a dung beetle, and strikes him down.

<br /><br />

Fatally wounded, Buzz Buzz imparts the knowledge Ness requires to locate the eight Sanctuaries and join forces with the power of the Earth itself. Giving him the Sound Stone, an item to record the melodies from the Sanctuaries, he passes away.

 - Ness may choose to take King, his dog, with himself while searching for Picky. If he does so, King will get frightened and run back home upon approaching the meteorite, leaving the party.

<br /><br />

 - Speaking to Lier X. Aggerate after meeting Buzz Buzz will result in him asking Ness to visit him alone later, claiming that he has something to show to Ness privately.

<br /><br />

By the time Ness leaves Pokey’s house, dawn would have broken. Although the town has countless different people speaking of a variety of subjects, a common topic turns out to be the Sharks -- and the Fresh Breeze Movement attempting to stop their “bad influences” on the children of Onett. This, coupled with the police force’s apparent inaction against the Sharks and rumors surrounding Frank’s knowledge of Giant Step, makes it a favorable idea for Ness to take matters into his own hands.

<br /><br />

Defeating any Sharks in the way and confronting Frank himself behind the Onett arcade, Ness manages to defeat both him and Frankystein Mark III, a robot he created. Recognizing Ness’s strength, Frank tells him all he knows of the Giant Step, but also warns him about the monster guarding it.

 - At this point, Ness can visit Lier X. Aggerate at his home. He will reveal that he has managed to excavate a statue, but will be defensive of it to the point of regarding Ness with some animosity. His subtle change in behavior, as well as his possession of the statue, becomes relevant as the story progresses.
