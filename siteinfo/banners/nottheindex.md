<p>
We here at Starmen.net love our banners, though <a href="http://starmen.net/siteinfo/banners.php" target="_blank">the ones we have now</a> are quite out of date.  Look at that explanation on that page!  Those had to have been made in 2000!  "Come, now," said PoeTrader, "certainly we can make newer banners!"  Many agreed, so now, we're holding a new banner contest!  Read the funbox below to say hello to our contest page!
