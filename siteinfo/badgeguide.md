So you want to know how you might get some pieces of flair for the forums and show your dedication to the site's community, eh? Or, would you rather decipher what exactly some user did to earn their badges? Well, whatever your reason for coming here, take a peek at the forum's many badges! These little icons are highly sought after (for some reason?) and each user can give a war story about how they received each of theirs. Try collecting them all! (Actually don't, it's nigh impossible!)

Badges that are currently able to be collected will have <font color="green">green names</font>. Badges that have been retired or are generally impossible to acquire any more will have <font color="grey">grey names</font>. For your convenience, the badges have been separated into sections.
