Starmen.Net, which was originally called EarthBound.Net, was started in February 1999 by Tomato and reidman. Basically it was created to be a large, central EarthBound site to help raise the level of quality of EarthBound-related content on the Internet.<br/><br/>Since EarthBound.Net/Starmen.Net's creation, many new EarthBound fans have appeared, many new, good EarthBound homepages have been created, and a strong community of EarthBound fans has been formed.<br/><br/>In early 2000, a sequence of odd events took place, forcing us to move to our current domain name, Starmen.Net. That is why some places on this site still refer to us as EarthBound.Net.<br/><br/>We hope that you enjoy your visit to Starmen.Net, and feel free to ask the webmaster any questions you may have.
