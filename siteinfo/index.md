Starmen.Net, which was originally called EarthBound.Net,
was started in February 1999 by <A HREF="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=usrinfo&id=288">Tomato</A>
and <A HREF="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=usrinfo&id=8">reidman</A>.  Basically it was created
to be a large, central EarthBound site to help raise the level of quality of
EarthBound-related content on the Internet.
<br /><br />
Since EarthBound.Net/Starmen.Net's creation, many new EarthBound fans have
appeared, many new, good EarthBound homepages have been created, and a strong
community of EarthBound fans has been formed.
<br /><br />
In early 2000, a sequence of odd events took place, forcing us to move
to our current domain name, Starmen.Net.  That is why some places on this site
still refer to us as EarthBound.Net. This and more about our history can be found <a href="/stonehenge">here</a>.
<br /><br />
We hope that you enjoy your visit to Starmen.Net, and feel free
to ask the <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@starmen.net">webmaster</A> any
questions you may have.
