<p>Some time ago Starmen.Net held a contest to decide upon new link banners, as the old ones had not been updated since the site had undergone a name change. The following were the winners; if you choose to link to Starmen.Net using a banner, we suggest you use one of these. Remember to save these to your own servers, instead of linking directly.</p>
