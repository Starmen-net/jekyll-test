Nintendo's usual Spaceworld event wasn't held in 1994, as Nintendo was trying to focus all its resources on the upcoming Nintendo 64 system. Instead, various gaming magazines held an event called Super Famicom Earthworld. At this event, MOTHER 2 was showcased. But as it was an industry-only event, not much is known.
