Nintendo Dream is a big magazine, strategy guide, etc. company in Japan. On August 26 and 27, 2006, the company held a sort of gallery show, displaying all the Nintendo-related stuff it had amassed over time. Among this is a LOT of awesome and incredibly rare MOTHER and EarthBound-related merchandise!
