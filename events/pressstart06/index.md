<ul>
 <li>Before the MOTHER Medley began, Sakurai said, "When you think of Nintendo RPGs, you think of Pokemon, right?" But Tanaka responded with, "Huh?! No, you mean MOTHER!"</li>

 <br /><br />
 <li>Unlike the three previous musical pieces, the MOTHER 3's introduction was pretty short, so it seemed to people that they weren't giving the MOTHER games much attention at all. But with the big guests that appeared during the performance and the numerous surprises, the feeling is they did the introduction like that on purpose to seem out of the ordinary.</li>

 <br /><br />
 <li>After the performance, Tanaka said, "I'd like to introduce not the mother of MOTHER, but the father," and Sakurai said, "We have an extremely big-time guest here with us," to which everyone in the seats responded with, "Eh?! Itoi?!"</li>

 <br /><br />
 <li>Just as Sakurai said, "Here's Shigesato Itoi!" Shigesato Itoi came out wearing a MOTHER 3 logo T-shirt and appeared on stage with Sakurai, who was wearing a Franklin Badge T-shirt.</li>
</ul>
