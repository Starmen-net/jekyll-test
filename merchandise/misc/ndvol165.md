	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	Nintendo Dream Vol. 165 features a big look at Super Mario Galaxy. It also includes a 67 full color mini-guide to SMG as well. But what is really important with this issue is found on page 143.
	<br /><br />
	It contains a full one page article on the <a href="http://starmen.net/ebsiege/japan/">PK Siege Japan</a>. There are pics of the Japanese Anthology, the EarthBound Video Album, the Fan Music CDs, a Mr. Saturn Resin Figurine, and a picture of some of the Starmen.Net staff. Featured in the picture from left to right - Plo, Jonk, ShadowX, Meeellla, and reidman. On the bottom left is Jason from the KoG, who passed on all this awesome stuff to the guys over at Nintendo Dream! Also part of the article, is a look at <a href="http://www.the-king-of-games.com/english/shop/index.php?mode=catalog_list&type=game&game_id=7
">the new MOTHER t-shirts</a> from the KoG. Big thanks goes out to Nintendo Dream and Jason of the KoG!

	Mazayuri blasts off with a special edition of this column... this time to introduce the King of Games MOTHER 3 T-Shirts and the passionate feelings that have arrived from overseas like a PK Fire!
	<br /><br />
	Super Awesome Goods Arrived from Overseas Fan Site Starman.net
	<br /><br />
	One day, an unusual package arrived at the desk of this Pigmask MOTHER staffer. Checking it revealed a humongous amount of MOTHER goods inside! This was none other than a present from Starman.net, an overseas fan site. Have a good look at these wonderful, numerous goods, which include a (handmade) compilation of tons of lovingly-drawn pictures, a small Mr. Saturn figure (also handmade), and more!
	<br /><br />
	(caption 1) The super-awesome anthology book is absolutely packed with passionate illustrations drawn by all the fans across the ocean. It's a real pity that we can't print it here due to magazine-related circumstances!
	<br /><br />
	(caption 2) They even made MOTHER music remix CDs and an independently-made video DVD of live-action MOTHER 2!
	<br /><br />
	(caption 3) The nice guys from Starman.net who gave us these wonderful presents
	<br /><br />
	Here's a comment from Jason, a supporter from Sarugakucho:
	<br /><br />
	"Upon seeing the presents everyone from Starman.net made, I could really feel their passionate hearts, so I brought one of the gifts to Mazayuri to try to spread the good word. MOTHER 3 hasn't been released overseas... so if you could, please "pray" that people overseas can someday play MOTHER 3 too (laugh)."
	<br /><br />
	Jason works at the company Sarugakucho, which works to make in-development games more fun through various means. He's on very close terms with Starman.net, and was the person who set up everything for this present.
	<br /><br />
	(You might notice, that Nintendo Dream misprints the sites name as Star<i>MAN</i>.net. In their next issue they do print an apology for this error)
