	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	This is the novel adaptation of the Mother 2 video game. Written by Kumi Saori it 
	contains 10 chapters, about 500 pages, and an afterword.
	<br /><br />
	The novel is completely written in Japanese. But again thankfully for the rest of us, 
	Tomato has started to translate the novel into English. However, it is not a full 
	translation, rather a summarization of each page. It is definitely worth a look if you 
	are interested in finding out some interesting facts, such as what Ness's Dad does for a 
	living.
