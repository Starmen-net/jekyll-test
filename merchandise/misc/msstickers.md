	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	These stickers are not only awesome because they are of Mr. Staurn, they also hold a 
	special meaning to us here at Starmen.Net. These stickers were the first indication 
	that a new Mother game might be on the way. Sure enough, soon after information about 
	the release of Mother 1+2 was everywhere. This 
	<a href="/merchandise/images/ms_stickers_sheet.jpg">sheet of stickers</a> came out in 
	late March and were part of a Nintendo of Japan's 'spring software book,' which has 
	promotions of some games that were going to be released the following summer.
