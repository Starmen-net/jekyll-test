	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
        This Japanese video has previews, <a href="/merchandise/images/perfectcommercial.jpg">commercials</a>, 
	and other good "things" for many Super Famicom games released in the early 1990s, 
	including Mother 2.  It is hosted by a <a href="/merchandise/images/perfectgroup.jpg">group of four people</a> 
	and a <a href="/merchandise/images/perfectbat.jpg">bat</a>. Information about games is presented in 
	several formats, including group discussions about the games and through a 
	<a href="/merchandise/images/perfectquiz.jpg">mock quiz game-show</a>.
        <br /><br />
        The Mother 2 segment is several minutes long.  Shigesato
        Itoi talks with one of the hosts about Mother 2.  Their dialogue isn't
        very interesting, but the video and sound of a pre-release version of
        Mother 2 that's playing while they're talking is very interesting.
	<br /><br />
	The pictures from the video and the digital video linked to below
	were captured off of a cheap TV-tuner, so the quality isn't as good
	as it could be.
