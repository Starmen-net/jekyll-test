	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	Seemingly out of no where, in the February 2006 issue of Nintendo Power a set of Retro 
	Stickers was inserted in the magazine. These may have appeared because this marked the 
	200th issue of Nintendo Power. Featured on the sheet of stickers are such 
	classic Nintendo characters as; Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong, NES), Ness (EarthBound, SNES), 
	Link (The Legend of Zelda, NES), Bowser (Super Mario Bros., NES), Icarus (Kid Icarus, 
	NES), Samus (Super Metroid, SNES), the Dog and Ducks (Duck Hunt, NES), the logos for 
	Nintendo, NES, SNES, N64, Gameboy, and a special 20 years Mario (Super Mario Bros., 
	NES). Ness being on there is just plain awesome.
	<br /><br />
	What does it mean? It might just be that someone over there at Nintedo Power has not 	forgotten about the underrated game called EarthBound. And that in itself means a lot.
