	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	Ness used the power of the Franklin Badge to deflect Carpainter's Thunder attacks. 
	Now you can have a Franklin Badge of your very own! That is, if you can find one. 
	But thanks to the release of Mother 3, that task is not as difficult anymore.
	<br /><br />
	Originally only 200 Franklin Badges were ever made. In Japan you had a chance of winning 
	one if you bought the 
	<a href="http://starmen.net/merchandise/guides/encyclopedia.php">Mother Encyclopedia</a> 
	or the 
	<a href="http://starmen.net/merchandise/guides/m1stratg.php">Mother 1 Strategy Guide</a>. 
	Printed on the cover's sleeve of these guides was an advertisement for a chance to enter into a drawing. 200 
	entrants would be randomly picked to receive a Franklin Badge. Talk about luck. 
	<br /><br />
	Then on April 20, 2006 in Japan Mother 3 was released. The 
	<a href="http://starmen.net/merchandise/misc/m3dlx.php">Mother 3 Deluxe Box</a> 
	was created as a special limited time preorder. Included in the box was Mother 3, a 
	GameBoy Micro with a special faceplate, and a Franklin Badge. The Mother 3 Deluxe Box 
	retailed for about 18,000 yen ($155).
	<br /><br />
	Two versions of the badge were made. One with a gold background, and one with a white 
	background. The gold ones are part of the original 200, and the white ones are the new 
	re-released edition. It is only an 1 Â¾" in size.
	<br /><br />
	In May of 2006, on Yahoo Japan Auctions, two original Franklin Badges along with their 
	corresponding guide; the ticket stating you won a Franklin Badge; and the winning letter 
	were up for bidding. The starting bid was 1,000,000 Yen (About $9000!). No one bid 
	on the auction. However what did come out of the auction were some great pictures 
	thanks to yokomako29.
