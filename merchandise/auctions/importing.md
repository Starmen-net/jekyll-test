	Looking for a specific Mother item? Tired of waiting for it to finally reach eBay? 
	Then go directly to the source! Check out <a href="http://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/">Yahoo Auctions Japan</a> 
	for all of your importing needs! However, all auctions will not be shipped 
	internationally. In order to successfully bid you will need to use an importing service.

	<br /><br />

	Here are some services you can use to help you start importing today! However please 
	keep in mind that using any services requires additional fees such as commissions and 
	international shipping. Things can get pretty pricey, so be sure to check out their 
	latest rates before using their services.

	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	Celga provides a number of services. Their primary service is bidding on Japanese 
	auctions for you and then receiving your item directly. All you have to do is email 
	them the link of the auction; your maximum bid; your shipping info; and deposit %50 
	of your maximum bid to their PayPal account. Yes, a valid PayPal account is required 
	in order to use their services. If you do not win any of the auctions you request then 
	your money will be returned in full. If you do win, then Celga will contact you with an 
	invoice clearly stating the final winning price, shipping costs, and commission fees.
	<br /><br />
	Would you rather bid on auctions yourself? Celga provides a Gold Membership program that 
	allows you to do just that! However this service will require a credit card. And with 
	Celga not only can you bid on Japanese auctions, you can order form Japanese web sites 
	as well! For a list of current rates and more information about their services check out 
	<a href="http://www.celga.com/">Celga.com</a>.
