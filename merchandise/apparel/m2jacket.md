	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	This is maybe one of the most awesome Mother 2 related apparel items ever created, but not much 
	was known about this jacket. However, with small pieces of information provided by the 
	Japanese auction it was recently sold off of and thanks to some internet searching, 
	pieces of information have fallen together to unwrap the mystery behind this jacket.
	<br /><br />
	This jacket was first worn by Shingo Katori of the J-Pop group SMAP on a Japanese 
	television show called Hey!Hey!Hey! Music Champ to help promote Mother 2. 
	Hey!Hey!Hey! Music Champ is a popular Japanese music based talk show hosted by 
	"Downtown," which is made up of two comedians named Matsumoto Hitoshi and Hamada 
	Masatoshi. Possibly the same jacket was also worn by Takuya Kimura another member of 
	SMAP. Takuya Kimura is a true fan of the Mother series as he can be seen in the 
	<a href="http://starmen.net/mother2/videos/">Japanese Mother 2 Commercial</a>. 
	During the summer of 1994, on the same day the Mother 2 commercial was first aired, 
	Takuya was attending an event called "Takuya Kimura Special Day." He was possibly 
	wearing this jacket at the event. This jacket was specially made to help promote 
	Mother 2. It is possible that only one was ever made. The size of this jacket is medium.
	<br /><br />
	Over the Winter of 2003 on a Japanese auction website this was auctioned off for 
	32,000 Yen, which is about $300.
