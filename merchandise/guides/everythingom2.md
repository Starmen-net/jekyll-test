	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	Similar to the <a href="everythingom.php">Everything of Mother 1</a> book. Everything
	of Mother 2 has a walkthrough on how to finish Mother 2 in a specific
	amount of time (24 hours in this case).  But different from the two,
	Everything of Mother 2 features information about the Mr. Saturn people ALL OVER the book.
	It even	describes different body parts of the Mr. Saturn and contains info on
	where the Mr. Saturn's actually originated from in 10 different listed theories
	(one being they were invaded from their "home" and had to move to Saturn
	Valley). It's all very interesting.
	<br /><br />
	Then there's the info on how to beat Mother 2 in less then 24 hours along
	with all the fun Mr. Saturn facts, I personally would think it'd be pretty
	sweet to page through this thing and check out all the cool Mr. Saturn info.
