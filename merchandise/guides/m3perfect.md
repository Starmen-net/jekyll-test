	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	One of the first guides released and with the most pages. This guide it broken up into 
	five major sections, which are: System, Character, Story, Sound Battle, and Data. The 
	System section just describes how to play the game. The Character section breaks down 
	all of the major characters you will encounter along your journey. The Story section is 
	the longest of all the sections, as it should be. In it contains all of the the games 
	chapters along with very small maps, item locations, and a detailed outline of that chapters 
	objectives. However, the chapter breaks are not very noticeable as it can be a pain 
	finding a specific chapter. And mentioning what kinds of enemies you will be facing 
	would have been nice too. The Sound Battle section is a very unique feature of this 
	guide. It attempts to explain how to time out your attacks to all of the battle music. 
	Once you read the diagram few times while playing, with practice it should be easy to 
	pick up. The last section is Data which contains a very detailed enemy, item, and PK database.
	<br /><br />
	Other then the database and objective outlines, this guide is not very text heavy. 
	A non-Japanese speaker could find this guide useful. The maps are very good even though 
	they are on the small side. And an explanation and example of the Sound Battle system 
	is a big help. Written in Japanese, 256 pages, full color. Originally sold on June 20th, 
	2006 for 1,200 Yen.
