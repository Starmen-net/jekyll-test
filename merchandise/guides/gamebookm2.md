	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	It's sort of hard to explain this piece of merchandise, due to
	the ammount of information I got on it, but this is what I believe it's
	about: You have a quest in this book, and there's charts you fill out
	as you progress through Mother 2 and as you get in battles etc.
