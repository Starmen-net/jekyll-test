	<i>Alright, well, I can't read japanese, but it's kinda like the <a href="ebpg.php">EarthBound Player's Guide</a> they released here in the
	USofA. There are alot of joke ads involving stuff in the game, like the Grey Hand Bus etc. There are also 
	photographs and other realistic things used as items and backrounds to make the book liike like a travel 
	guide. A few of the bonuses are there are clay models that are in there that were not even in the M2 CD 
	booklet, ie. the tough guy model and zombie dog. (Also there are a lot of models with different angles of 
	ones already seen, they make them looks more dynamic.) There are names of the characters too, for instance 
	Poo's master is called Yee-soo-chi, That infamous telephone head guy is called Denwa and Star Master is 
	called Ryan-Woo-Pa, the images that do not have clay models are also very well cropped graphics, not just 
	a terrible screenshot.
	<br /><br />

	There is also a collection of pictures, where you can get all the photographs. Although it's in japanese, 
	everything seems VERY thorough. Every time the game begins a 'new chapter' there is some nice conept art 
	of the area it's based in.. ie. lost underwordl has a few mountains and the dinos peeking around them. 
	There is also some info about musicians (no idea who they are) called BAAAD Trip, I think they had something 
	to do with the music of the game. And finally, in a nutshell, it's alot like our guide (without the smelly 
	cards, hehe.) Only they have additions like; each person who had a large part in the making of the game 
	and a description about them, weird how japan takes things like that seriously.<br />
