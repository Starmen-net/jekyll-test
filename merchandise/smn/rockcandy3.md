	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	The third CD in the Rock Candy series. 
	Rock Candy is the EarthBound fan-made music Soundtrack CD series. This soundtrack 
	is an on-going process of CD's that will continue to be released as more EarthBound 
	fan related music is created. The Rock Candy Soundtrack was intentionally created to 
	reward those that had contributed to the genre of Earthbound and Starmen.Net 
	significantly. Jonk created this soundtrack from fellow musicians who have produced 
	songs that are EarthBound inspired and bring a new view on the music of the Mother 
	series. Each track has been properly timed, faded and recorded to ensure a prime audio 
	sound. Some tracks have been slightly modded to improve the song's presentation.

	Just like the first two in the series, this soundtrack has a wide variety of songs from 
	EarthBound making it yet another Earthbound audio experience to enjoy. Talents range 
	from SLing's soulful piano to Cromkayer's amazing guitar skills. From the realistic feel 
	of LousySpy's renditions to the funky fresh mixes of shadow. And in the final tracks 
	some SMN regulars get a little wacky. Including reidman! The series has become something 
	legendary and is enjoyed by the whole community. As always you can expect more great 
	fan-made music on future editions of Rock Candy! You may be able to listen to many of 
	these tracks on <a href="http://starmen.net/funstuff/radio/">Radio PSI</a>.
	<br /><br />
	Special thanks goes out to all those that made this soundtrack possible and to 
	Starmen.Net for keeping the EarthBound community alive. All rights and credits are 
	reserved to the song's creators themselves. This CD series is not for sale and will 
	never be, EVER. The only way to obtain one is to contribute significantly to the 
	Earthbound community by fan art, funfest winners, EarthBound Site Spotlight, Fan Art of 
	the Week, fan music, fan fic, or maintaince of or contribution to Starmen.net to keep it

	sequel.
