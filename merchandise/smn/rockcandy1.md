	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	The first CD in the Rock Candy series. 
	Rock Candy is the EarthBound fan-made music Soundtrack CD series. This soundtrack 
	is an on-going process of CD's that will continue to be released as more EarthBound 
	fan related music is created. The Rock Candy Soundtrack was intentionally created to 
	reward those that had contributed to the genre of Earthbound and Starmen.Net 
	significantly. Jonk created this soundtrack from fellow musicians who have produced 
	songs that are EarthBound inspired and bring a new view on the music of the Mother 
	series. Each track has been properly timed, faded and recorded to ensure a prime audio 
	sound. Some tracks have been slightly modded to improve the song's presentation.

	This soundtrack has a wide variety of songs from EarthBound making it an Earthbound 
	audio experience not to forget. The songs are not ordered in any way but each CD 
	welcomes you with the familiar EarthBound introduction as if you were playing it. 
	Talents range from the crashing symbols of BTP to the haunting beats of Lis Vender. 
	From the firery guitar and blazing brass of Cromkayer to the awesumo remixes by 
	Spekkosaurus. And lets not forget the rap song by Sephy we all have come to love! 
	There are a lot of other music on this CD that will want to make you listen over and 
	over again! As this series expands and more songs are made and more CD's are produced, 
	this will be the one of the best collections of fan-made video game music ever compiled. 
	You may be able to listen to many of these tracks on 
	<a href="http://starmen.net/funstuff/radio/">Radio PSI</a>.
	<br /><br />
	Special thanks goes out to all those that made this soundtrack possible and to 
	Starmen.Net for keeping the EarthBound community alive. All rights and credits are 
	reserved to the song's creators themselves. This CD series is not for sale and will 
	never be, EVER. The only way to obtain one is to contribute significantly to the 
	Earthbound community by fan art, funfest winners, EarthBound Site Spotlight, Fan Art of 
	the Week, fan music, fan fic, or maintaince of or contribution to Starmen.net to keep it

	sequel.
