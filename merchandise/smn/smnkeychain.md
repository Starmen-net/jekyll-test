	<br />
	It's been a long time coming but it's finally here, the Starmen.Net Insignia Keychain! 
	Based off of the symbol worn by the legion of Starmen from EarthBound, this insignia 
	has been the crest of Starmen.Net since its formation in 1998. This is as amazing as it 
	looks. The keychain is made of a high quality silver metal and is inlaid with antique 
	silver. It's size is 1/2" high and 1" long, the right size for any pocket. Manufactured 
	by <a href="http://www.lapelpinsrus.com/diestruck.html">Die Struck Lapel Pins</a>, but 
	found exclusively here!
