	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	Only 3 ever printed, an extremely rare piece of merchandise to say the least.  
	It was first used on the Mother on GameBoyColor petition, then reidman gave 
	the other 2 to Natechan and <a href="mailto:sling@starmen.net">SLing</a>
	who some know won the Essay Contest that was held.  He won an EarthBound cartridge, 
	along with the Starmen.net sticker in replace of a player's guide.  The other was 
	given to Natechan from reidman, I think he lost it though.
	<br /><br />
	Though this is only a sticker which didn't take much time to make, it is the rarest 
	piece of merchandise that is archived here at Starmen.Net.
