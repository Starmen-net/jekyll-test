	<b>Information:</b>
	<br />
	The second CD in the Rock Candy series. 
	Rock Candy is the EarthBound fan-made music Soundtrack CD series. This soundtrack 
	is an on-going process of CD's that will continue to be released as more EarthBound 
	fan related music is created. The Rock Candy Soundtrack was intentionally created to 
	reward those that had contributed to the genre of Earthbound and Starmen.Net 
	significantly. Jonk created this soundtrack from fellow musicians who have produced 
	songs that are EarthBound inspired and bring a new view on the music of the Mother 
	series. Each track has been properly timed, faded and recorded to ensure a prime audio 
	sound. Some tracks have been slightly modded to improve the song's presentation.

	<br /><br />
	Much like the first, this soundtrack has a wide variety of songs from EarthBound making 
	it another Earthbound audio experience to enjoy. Talents range from the soft piano and 
	hard rockin' guitar of Kyosuke to the awesome beats & mixes of shadow. This CD also 
	contains some amazing vocal tracks. Here you will find the classic voice of Sephy on 
	several tracks and the punk-sure beats by Abide. You can also hear a very special vocal 
	rendition of the Venus Concert by Injury & Aquas. The series is shaping up to be 
	something truly awesome and unique. Expect more great fan-made music on future editions 
	of Rock Candy! You may be able to listen to many of these tracks on 
	<a href="http://starmen.net/funstuff/radio/">Radio PSI</a>.
	<br /><br />
	Special thanks goes out to all those that made this soundtrack possible and to 
	Starmen.Net for keeping the EarthBound community alive. All rights and credits are 
	reserved to the song's creators themselves. This CD series is not for sale and will 
	never be, EVER. The only way to obtain one is to contribute significantly to the 
	Earthbound community by fan art, funfest winners, EarthBound Site Spotlight, Fan Art of 
	the Week, fan music, fan fic, or maintaince of or contribution to Starmen.net to keep it

	sequel.

	by Pitchshifter, but it is on Rock Candy Soundtrack 2. It's a shame we didn't notice 
	this before. Our apologizes to Pitchshifter.
