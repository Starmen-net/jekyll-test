      <br />
      The Funfest is an event that used to be held at Starmen.Net multiple times yearly. This year for the holiday season we've decided to bring it back! The Funfest is, basically, a chance for people to be creative and show off their abilities. Anyone may participate, and may submit as many items as they come up with. The idea is for you to do what you're best at and what you have fun doing. For example, artists may want to draw a cool picture. People with decent writing skills may want to try their hand at a fanfic.
      <br /><br />

      </center>
      <br />
      There are no real limitations to what type of files you submit. Here are some suggestions:
      <br /><br />
      <ul>
         <li class="black" />Fanfic (.txt .doc .html)
         <li class="black" />Poem/Song (.txt .doc .html .wav .mp3)
         <li class="black" />Music (.xm .it .mid .mp3 .wav)
         <li class="black" />Fanart/Flukes (.gif .jpg)
         <li class="black" />Multimedia (Flash, Shockwave, VRML, .avi .mpg)
      </ul>

      <br /><br />
      Please keep in mind that these are not the only files that can be submitted.
      However, all files submitted MUST fit under the theme for the funfest. This
      Funfest's theme is 'the holiday season'. Entries that don't fit the theme at
      all won't be eligible for any prizes, so don't stray off course!

     <br />
     Now the important part. This section will give you all the information you'll
     need to know so you can be sure your submission gets to us properly.
     <br /><br />
     First off, this time around, we're using a submission format. So read the guidlines
     before you send that stuff off. If you have any problems with the submission form,
     send them to <a href="Mailto:funfest@starmen.net">funfest@starmen.net</a>.
     <br /><br />
     Here are the submission guidelines:
     <ul>
        <li class="black" />All files must relate to the theme of the Funfest somehow! The theme of this funfest is 'the holiday season'.<br /><br />
        <li class="black" />Uploaded files are not to be more than 2 MB
           in size. Files of over 2 MB in size must be uploaded to an OUTSIDE FTP site
           (such as Geocities or a personal website). Links to outside files may be
           e-mailed to <a HREF="mailto:funfest@starmen.net">funfest@starmen.net</a>.<br /><br />
        <li class="black" />Files must not contain anything vulgar,
           obscene, or unacceptable in any way. reidman will judge the acceptability of files.<br /><br />

        <li class="black" />Files with extensions that could be
           potentially harmful (such as .vbs and .bat) will be rejected. Executable files
           (.exe) will be scanned for virii before admission into the Funfest.<br /><br />
        <li class="black" />Multiple files will be accepted from a
           single participant. However, each participant may win only ONE prize.<br /><br />
        <li class="black" />Please, put effort into your submissions.<br /><br />
        <li class="black" />And finally, the deadline for <b>ALL</b> entries is <b>JANUARY 10TH!!!</b> Stick to it!<br /><br />
     </ul>

   Your submission will be deleted if you use the incorrect form.  Also note
   that files totalling over 5MB are automatically deleted, as are files that
   have the extension BMP(Windows bitmap files; they are excessively large).
   To convert from BMP to another format, use a utility like
   <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</a> or <a href="http://gimp.org">GIMP</a>.
   <br /><br />

   If you need to send a file larger than the limit, contact the section
   maintainer to work out something.
   <br /><br />
   The name and email address fields are for the creator of the work you
      are uploading.  Do <b><u>NOT</u></b> enter your name and/or email address if you did not
      create the work.  If multiple people created the work, place a note
      about it in the "Description of Files" field.
