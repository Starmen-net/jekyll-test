Nintendo has ignored <a href="/mother2">EarthBound</a> fans for over a decade. It's time for us to make our final stand, and not with a petition. Each of us is personally communicating with Nintendo -- sending letters, drawing artwork, and talking with them in person, on the phone. Will they finally recognize us, or is this the end of the line?

<b>You</b>, the person reading this, will help <b>determine the fate of MOTHER 3</b>. You will determine whether EarthBound and MOTHER ever see the light of day in America (and beyond) ever again.

Illustrashawn, one of the site's most talented artists, made this piece for a project that we are working on as a special part of EB SIEGE. The intense detail and pure skill that is living within this stunning piece is absolutely amazing. This artwork was so awesome, I wanted to share it with everyone! Download the <a href="http - //jonk.fobby.net/smn/art/misc/chosen4_small_illustrashawn.jpg" target="_blank"><b><u>The Chosen 4 - Fan-Sized</u></b></a> image (wallpaper it maybe? :D) and hopefully this will help inspire for the <a href="http://starmen.net/forum/?t=thread&frm_id=76" target="_blank"><b><u>EB SIEGE!</u></b></a> Plus we will be giving out sweet forum badges for those that submit entries into EB SIEGE so stay tuned for that!
