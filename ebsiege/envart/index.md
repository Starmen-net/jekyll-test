<a href="http://starmen.net/forum/?t=msg&amp;th=33499"><b><i>The Envelope Art Siege</i></b></a> is a combination of letters and art packaged together as one. Nintendo Power is no longer doing an official section letter art section, but they have highlighted envelope art in fetured articles specifically on this site and envelope art coming from fans here! They will still publish it and they will pass it on to those eyes that have a potential to make a difference. This is for those that want to draw, and coupled with this talent of art will be a written letter expressing the hopes of this franchise in Nintendo.

<contentbox>What will be done is that these letter will collected by me, scannned in a ultra-resolution image and posted for all to see. The more important thing is that these envelopes are going to be collected and mailed to Nintendo (NoA). Like last time when this occured, there was a full page talking about EB and highlighted an article on the previous NP Siege. We aim to do this again and continue the impression. This is only one phase of many phases to come. Get those pencils, pens, digital tools going because this is going to be high profile and we are going to make sure that Nintendo remembers us! Make Starmen.Net and EarthBound proud. Let's <b><i>EB SIEGE!</i></b>
