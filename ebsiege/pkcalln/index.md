This will be like the old days where we made an actual voice to voice connection. PK Call'N is back connecting vocally with Nintendo and speaking our minds on what we want as fans. More Mother/Earthbound! However this time things will be different from the previous PK Call'Ns....
<br /><br />
<font size="4"><b>The calls will not stop until our voices are heard.</b></font>
<br /><br />
This time PK Call'N is a non-stop call-a-thon that will last weeks, even months if need be. The reason this is not a week long event as it has been in the past is because that is just not strong enough. Our message will be heard for that week, but then will fade along with the calls. So to keep that from happening the calls will not stop this time. Overcoming the fear of punching a few numbers is something we have to do to make sure that our voice is heard and in mass numbers. Please continue to read on for the complete details and be apart of the largest PK Call'N ever assembled.

PK-Call'N organizes the entire EarthBound/Mother series community to call Nintendo of America. Our request to them will be to please port over Mother 3 to North America, bring EarthBound to the Virtual Console, or even ask about a potential Mother 1+2+3 DS Compilation. Let them know you want to see more Mother/EarthBound in the US again!
<br /><br />
We need as many people to keep calling in for the best impact. Previous examples of this effective maneuver is when Zelda: Master Quest was brought to North America after 500 people called Nintendo. The previous PK-Call'Ns made a definite impact on Nintendo of America. NoA Representative's still talk about how many calls they gotten during these events. In fact, recent information tells us that Mother 1+2 was flagged for discussion due to a high volume of calls during a previous PK Call'N. However the calls stopped and it was assumed that interest had died and it was never brought up again. This time the interest won't die and the calls won't stop.

Following the steps above, you will be talking with NoA. Be original and polite in your call and mention why you are calling. Mention you read about Mother 1+2 in Nintendo Power, or heard about Mother 3 released in Japan, the Mother 3 iTunes tracks, or have just been a long-time fan of that wacky SNES game from years ago. Or even ask them straight out, "where is EarthBound?" And keep in mind you want to talk about EarthBound, not promote an event or a web site so....<br /><br />

<b><u>...DO NOT MENTION PK-CALL'N, EB SIEGE OR STARMEN.NET!</u></b><br /><br />

The NoA Representative might correct you and refer to the SNES EarthBound. They may assume that you didn't know about this game. Don't be abrupt, they are only providing info that they feel would help you. The NoA Representative will likely give an address to write in to Nintendo. If you would like to write to NoA check out <a href="http://starmen.net/ebsiege/pkmailn/">PK Mail'N</a>! They may ask you about your subscription to Nintendo Power, so try to be polite and understand that they are trying to keep you informed.<br /><br />

The NoA Representative most likely will have no new information. Politely thank them <b>and tell them you will be a calling back soon to check up to see if any new information is available.</b> Call back again in a few days time to see if any new information is available. If not, thank them again and call back once more in a few days! If there is still no new information, then ask to speak to an available manager and see if they can help you out. Call as often as you can and get your friends or family members involved as well! And this time don't worry about the length of the call. Ask what you want to ask and show that you are a fan of the series! But always be sure to be polite and thank the person you are speaking with when you call. Following this should result in a smooth call!

When calling please follow these guidelines:<br /><ul>
<li>Don't be rude. You are talking to a person, not a machine. They are at work right now having a bunch of people calling them and requesting a game to be imported. I am sure they didn't go to work today expecting this. Treat them with respect.</li>
<li>Be as mature as possible. We want them to take us seriously, not just dismiss us as some pranksters.</li>
<li>The person you are talking to DOES NOT make the decision to bring Mother 1+2 and 3 over to North America. Their job is to relay our message to their higher-ups at Nintendo and show them that we truly want this series stateside.</li>
<li>Make AS MANY calls as you can per household. If your friends, brother, sister, mom, dad, or even grandma wants to also see more Mother/EarthBound then have them call in as well! The more the better!</li>
<li>The person you are talking to might be under going training, and these phone calls are being monitored by Nintendo of America customer quality assurance. Try to understand that the person you are talking to has a job to do and may not have all the answers to what you ask them</li>
</ul>
