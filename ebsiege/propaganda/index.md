<a href="http://starmen.net/forum/?t=msg&amp;th=31493"><b><i>EB Propaganda</i></b></a>This is the all in all area where we assault the visual radar of Nintendo and media agencies by creating off the wall, art, music, video, whatever that empowers people to get engaged in EarthBound. As fans, we know the game well, but this is to inform and interest people in EB. The smarter the idea and its delivery, the more it becomes effective. With this, we can show that we are not just fans of doodles, of a fanbase of thinkers and do'ers.

This is project different from the EB ENV-ART. This is a freeform expression that isnt constratined by envelopes nor contains a personal letter. You can explore whatever medium, whatever you want to draw on, photography, music, video, 2-d, 3-d, whatever! This is entire creative freedom, but it must be encapturing, and ZEALOUS! Whatever the case, make a propaganda poster to foster a FURVOR and AMBITIOUS nature about EB. You are FIGHTING for this game and convince the people with this poster to be interested in this franchise!Since this is a fan effort and not only one voice should be seen infront of many, I felt this would be the best option to hit it to 'em. <br /><br />
