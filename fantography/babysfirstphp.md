Wait, so I just put stuff in here and it shows up on the page? I mean, how does this work exactly?

Regardless, I decided to make my own page instead of editing something that somebody already made just so I don't screw up the whole section. Moooooooo. I figure this is good enough for the first box, right? Cool.

Alright, so here's the second box. <br />

This really shows my reaction to this system. But I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.<br /><br />

Hey, reidman! I'm one of the guys running Fantography, and as I was processing your submission I noticed that the dimensions were a bit too big. <br /><br />

We try to keep it under 1024 pixels wide (simply because it won't fit people's screens otherwise), so if you could shrink it down to 1024 pixels wide or less that'd be awesome! I'd love to see your photo show up in one of our updates, so once it's been shrunken just resubmit it and everything will be peachy keen! <br /><br />

Updates are hard, man. Wicked hard the first time. But, alas, future Sith and/or any Fantography dude that comes after me will have to know how to make an update, so I guess here's how you do it? <br /><br />

First, take all the ones you want to update with and check all of them in the checkbox underneath the "Group" button. You'll also need to process them one by one by clicking the "Unprocessed" link in the green box. <br /><br />

Then once all are checked and processed, hit the "HTMLitize!" button at the top of the page. Then you'll want to copy/paste the text from the top text box and put it in place of the "Insert Submission Code Here" text in this
