People born in the Year of the Fobby are known for being lazy and soft hearted, but this sometimes works against them. They are very artistic, but also somewhat superficial, rarely taking the time to really get to know people before judging them. They try and think of others, but oftentimes end up acting out in self-indulgent ways. Never the less, the shy Fobbies are very careful and usually keep to themselves.
