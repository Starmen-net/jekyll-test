People born in the year of the Rowdy Mouse have a lot of guts. They're never afraid to charge head-first into a new project or idea and will recover quickly if the project fails. As a result of this, however, Rowdy Mice sometimes take a bit longer to learn from their past mistakes. They can also go from happy to angry in the blink of an eye if the conditions are right. It may take a Rowdy Mouse a long time to forgive someone, but they will eventually patch up all problems. They're happiest when they're having fun with the people they love.
