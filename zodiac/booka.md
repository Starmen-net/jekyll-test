People born in the Year of the Crested Booka have a certain flair for style. They often go against the norm and have their own unique ways of dealing with stress and deadlines. Bookas are ambitious, hardworking, and creative. Though they might sometimes rely a little too heavily on their friends when times are tough, they're always there to return the favor when one of their own friends is in need. Bookas are very competitive and might not always know when to back down in a fight, but they always stick to their beliefs. Also, they are great, if not overenthusiastic, dancers.
