People born in the Year of the Runaway Dog are very active by nature. They are constantly thinking of new ideas and have trouble with finishing everything they start. Playful and quick-thinking, Runaway Dogs are usually good at sports, but are also known to slug around and play video games when their brain needs a break. Jealously is often a Runaway Dog's biggest flaw and they have to work hard to not let this trait ruin friendships.
