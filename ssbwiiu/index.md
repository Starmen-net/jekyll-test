<p><img class="picleft" src="/ssbb/screenshots/gameplay1.gif" title="" />The third installment of Nintendo's successful series <i>Super Smash Bros</i>! The Smash Bros. series has always been about staple Nintendo characters duking it out, and Brawl is no different. Not only does Brawl bring back the action-packed multiplayer experience fans know and love, it also adds a new Adventure mode called The Subspace Emissary, an unprecedented journey across a massive landscape with intertwining stories between characters from Nintendo's franchises. With 35 characters and 41 stages, there's a lot to experience.

For more information, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/">the official Smash. Bros. website</a>, which was updated slowly until the game was released, for complete details on the game.</p>
