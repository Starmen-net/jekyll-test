<p>While many believed it was only a mere folktale, the Mother series directly connects with a legend discovered in our own world: the Annual Gift Man from the Moon. This chap is the famous leader of the well known holiday, EB No Matsuri, and is the cause of the random gift boxes found in the Mother universe. Because his holiday comes but only once a year, Annual Gift Man tends to bore of life on the moon. All he has to do to prepare for EB No Matsuri is to cultivate his immense stock of flesh-eating virii and make the occassional bid on ebay for an EB cart. His wonderful band of kangaroos are not much fun either, especially considering Blinkey's recent withdraw of Hostess Twinkies.</p>

<p>So, the infamous man boards his bathtub and sets off on an adventure himself. He finds it amusing to fill boxes, decorated as presents, with random junk he finds on his travels. With his specialized telescope, when he returns home to the moon, he amuses himself with the reactions of those his find his gifts. Because of this hobby, it is the true orgin of his infamous name.</p>

<p>He also finds it hysterical when one opens a gag box. He especially found it suitable to fill Saturn Valley with a bundle of, stinky surprises...
He laughs as a boy finds an enemy in a box and the reaction of the man who is surprised with a rotten pastrie right after being blasted in the face with ghostly gas. It is true, the Annual Gift Man cares not about the well being of any hero, but simply does so to amuse his own self. Whether you choose to take the bait is solely your own choice, but be warned for the surprise that may be in store.</p>

<p>Throughout time, the chosen heroes have had present boxes, conveniently scattered throughout the world. The chosen ones can leave the presents alone for as long as they want, but when they return to it, the present boxes are still left unopened. There is actually a good reason to why there are presents scattered throughout the world.</p>

<p>In the Mother universe, time travel is something which has been done constantly. Someone from the future could travel to the past and alter something so that the future turns out for the better. In the possibility that the heroes fell, someone from the future could travel back in time and try to make sure that the heroes didn’t fall. But time travel is a risky thing as it can destroy your physical body, or it can horrifically age you, or it can turn you into a fly… maybe.</p>

<p>If everyone who wanted to change the future did this, then they would definitely be followed by some of Giygas’s minions who will kill them all before they could do anything. So what they do instead is send items to the past so that they can arrive at random points in the heroes’ journey to help the heroes’ out. They can’t use phase distorters as Giygas had gotten rid of all of them already. So the citizens of the future have to disguise their items as something less suspicious, such as present boxes. </p>

<p>If they can make the boxes out of quantum particles, then the boxes will travel through time without the use of a phase distorter. Quantum particles have the ability to think for themselves despite being small particles; they know that they have to reach the heroes so that the future could be made for the better. So they travel in time to the point where the heroes were still alive. They are never opened by any other being because they only appear whenever the hero they were waiting for comes around. </p>

<p>If you didn’t understand that let me explain that in simpler terms: magic!</p>
