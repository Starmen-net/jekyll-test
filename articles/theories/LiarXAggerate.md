Nearly everything that you need to know about a Mr. Aggerate is found within his name. He is a liar. This has become his defining character trait. He is deceptive, manipulative, and once had dreams of ruling the world with a reign built upon mistruths. Perhaps the pinnacle of Mr. Aggerate's deceptive ways is the long-ago construction of an illusion-building device known as the Mind Altering Neurological Interrupter Molded Around Nefarious Ideas, or MANIMANI. As a punishment for his lies and to protect the world which he once tried to conquer, the forces of the universe arranged it so that Liar X. Aggerate's defining character trait has become him.<p/>

Liar X. Aggerate is the incarnation of the lies told by people around the world. For as long as people tell lies, Liar X. Aggerate lives. He can not find eternal piece or escape from his past transgressions for as long as mankind continues to deceive. Liar X. Aggerate has lived for a very, very long time, and has grown weary of an eternal existence.<p/>

The first step in finding release, Liar X. Aggerate knows, is in the destruction of the MANIMANI, though this is a task that can only be carried out by a particular type of person - one with incredible psychic power and an ability to see through illusion. If the machine were to fall into any other hands, the lies and deception in the world would only increase. It is for these reasons that Liar X. Aggerate constructed an artificial hill with which to hide his invention. Deep in the bowels of this mound, beneath Mr. Aggerate's house, the machine awaits the arrival of a certain boy. When this child arrives, Mr. Aggerate is certain to introduce the child to the evil instrument that he has hidden for all these years. <p/>

In the beginnig of Earthbound, as you climb the hill to the meteorite, you might've ran into a billboard building, treasure hunting, all around creepy man by the name of Liar X. Aggerate. The last thing we truly get to know about him is that he sells the dark-minded Mani-Mani statue to a Mr. Carpainter. However, this theorist knew that couldn't be where his story ended, and with research and random DNA tests, I've come over a few discoveries.<p/>

Think about it, even in Earthbound standards, Liar X. Aggerate seems like a bit of a fake name. That's because, it is! My curiosity first led me to the now calm Happy-Happy Village, where I decided to interview Mr. Carpainter. I didn't truly get much out of that, except for one thing. Carpainter was only his first name. He, as far as he knew had no family, except for a brother he thought got abducted by aliens.<p/>

Now I moved back to have a chat with Mr. Liar. He said nothing, but I decided I could put the puzzle together on my own. Mr. Liar was actually a man by the name of Mr. Truckdrawer. Now some might question, why wouldn't Mr Truckdrawer reunite with his brother? Simple, he didn't respect him as a brother anymore.<p/>

Apparently, by the age of 15(ish), Carpainter and Truckdrawer argued who could live a better life, Carpainter wanting to be a mayor, and Truckdrawer wanting to be a treasure hunter. It's apparent who won that bet, but let's now focus on Truckdrawers dissappearance.<p/>

About a year after their bet was made, Carpainter focused his studies on government, while Truckdrawer dropped out of school and secretly left the area to find treasure, unknown to anyone. For some reason it wasn't until 3 years after that that Carpainter actually noticed his brother's dissappearance, so he came up with a lame excuse of aliens (unaware it'd be a possibility in a few more years.)<p/>

Now on Truckdrawer's adventure for treasure, he forgot to trip his shoelaces and fell on a rock, but that wasn't anything new. It wasn't until he took another step when he stepped on his now dropped shovel and slammed him in the face knocking him out. He awoke 3 days later in a village filled with unusual, short creatures with whiskers and red bows. He got shocked finding himself in a trashcan and ran out of the village, only hearing one thing as he left...BOING!<p/>

One skill he had was his ability to run, and boy did he run. He ran past a lot of towns until he found a shack on a hill to rest in. It was weird, he didn't here anybody come to the shack for days. He peeked his head out and was seen by a small family consisting of a mother, father, a daughter, and son. He got scared, but all they did was welcome him to the neighborhood. He actually felt, welcome near a group of people, but when the time came for his introduction, he had to think of something quick.<p/>

"MY NAME!Uh...it's, uh, Liar X, yeah yeah! Liar X. Aggerate!" It seemed like a weird nickname, but it was the name they always refered to him as.<p/>

He lived this life for many years, still aware of his brother, who he heard became mayor of a small town. He felt like a failure, and he didn't want to meet his brother again, only to get insulted again, but he still kept at his treasure hunting. He got lucky within his own house soon, and found a giant gold statue. As beautiful as it was, he knew he could get a good penny off of it. Sadly, he had no clue who would even want to buy it. It was beautiful, but kinda creepy. Then he thought of a plan to get a good laugh off of.<p/>

He lugged the statue over to the small town his brother was supposed to be mayor of. When he arrived with the statue, the mayor was shocked at such an interesting statue. He, offered a lot of money for the statue, but just as Truckdrawer was about to laugh at his brother saying he won the bet, his brother asked,"So what's your name stranger?" This hurt Truckdrawer. He knew his brother was serious. Has it been that long? He just used his fake name. He got his money, and decided, it was time to actually make a name for himself. He moved away from his shack, and sadly hasn't been seen by my eyes since.<p/>

Did he succeed in his new wish? Did he waste his money? Is he learning more to be a better person. I don't know? I haven't heard a thing about him since he left.<p/>

Now, did I ever tell Carpainter about his brother. Of course not! That guy creeps me out! Plus, I like red over blue.<p/>

Thus is the story of Li-err, Mr. Truckdrawer. Another ashed question, now a bright flame. Til next week, this is Pheen-X (Firej7) saying, WHO ARE YOU!<p/>

Who am I, you ask? My name is Lier X. Aggerate. I’m a retired Olympic medal-winning synchronized swimmer.<p/>

What do you mean, you don’t believe that?<p/>

All right, all right, you got me. I was actually a world-class explorer who, after seeing the world, grew tired of fame and settled in Onett. Of course you’ve never heard of me!<p/>

...You want the truth? That was the truth!<p/>

All right, fine. Here’s how it really went down.<p/>

I used to live in the big city, livin’ large. Me and my pal Everdred, we did some... shady business around those parts. You know, robbing banks, mugging old ladies, putting cats in trees, all that good, illegal stuff. We turned a fine profit, and boy, we lived the life! It was perfect.<p/>

Until one day, one of our heists went wrong. We accidentally tripped an alarm and in came the police! I made up a story about me trying to stop Everdred from committing the crime and they believed me. Everdred was stuck in jail, but he sent me some nasty threats. They decided to put me in witness protection. I changed my name and moved to the hill outside of town. I was then able to resume my activities of being creepy and following young kids around.<p/>

So that’s my story. You may not believe it, but that’s on your head, not mine.<p/>

Lier X. Agerate is a simple man, who at best, is a bit of an exaggerator, right? Well, it turns out, he has had a story as to how he gained his lying streak. The story goes as follows-I was neither a murder suspect, nor a target for an international spy organization. But I drove a car down the Jersey Turnpike at 80 mph. ...A police officer pulled me over and asked for my driver's license. He said I was going 20 mph over the speed limit. I instantly pointed to my wife and said, "I'm in a hurry, my wife is in labor." Fortunately, my wife actually had a big stomach. I hoped he'd let me go with this excuse. "Oh, since it's an emergency. I'll lead you to the hospital with my police car," he said. "No, it's not necessary." "Why not?" asked the officer. "Uh... well..." "Let's get going," said the officer... "No, no! We can't! This baby is a demon child!" And yes, I remembered 3/4ths of that article from memory.<p/>
