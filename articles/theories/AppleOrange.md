<center>Apple Kid and Orange Kid. Two matching inventors in the town of Twoson. That's way too similar to be a coincidence. How are these two related, and how did their rivalry come to exist?</center>

Apple and Orange Kid may seem like your average rival inventors, but this rivalry didn’t always exist. In fact, just the opposite used to be true!<p/>

It all started just a month ago. Twoson was hosting the first-ever Eagleland Science and Engineering Festival, and all the greatest designers of Onett, Twoson, Threed, and Fourside were planning to attend, without a doubt. The grand prize was, after all, $10,000 in cash. Likewise, two close childhood friends, nicknamed Apple and Orange Kid, were bound to compete, teaming up together to create something truly amazing on account of their love for science.
…And, of course, they could use the money.<p/>

The two locally-renowned child geniuses collaborating on a large-scale invention was going to be tough to beat. And besides that, Apple and Orange Kid didn’t have much opposition, with most of the world’s other top inventors residing far away-- in Winters, Foggyland.<p/>

Twoson citizens were without a doubt; their childhood heroes would win it all, guaranteed.<p/>

Unfortunately, our youthful inventors suffered from… creative dissonance. While Orange Kid was set on creating an invention that would “spread peace and goodwill on Earth”, Apple Kid’s ideas were centered more on novelty gadgets and machines, which his friend immediately dismissed as useless and silly. Orange Kid found his “pencil eraser” proposal to be particularly ridiculous.<p/>

Seizing control of the materials budget and the creative input, Orange Kid began building his greatest work yet. His plan was to create a revolutionary power source, one that could power houses, schools, entire cities… even an alien’s secret base! Orange Kid was positive that this would be the great creation that would benefit all mankind. Unfortunately, like most of Orange Kid’s inventions… it didn’t work.<p/>

Fortunately, however, Apple Kid fixed it right up, even increasing the machine’s efficiency tenfold! Orange Kid had always been amazed by, yet somewhat envious of his friend’s technological expertise…<p/>

Anyways, the kids’ invention astonished the judges, audience, and competitors to no end, and as all would come to expect, Apple and Orange Kid walked home with first-place trophy, and the $10,000 grand-prize. Orange Kid figured that he never really had to try ever again. He already had it all: the fame, the glory, the honor, the girls (Yeah, you remember, “I'm nuts about this one kid inventor. No, not that airheaded, dweeby Apple Kid. I'm talking about the incredibly hot Orange Kid!”), and the money, which he apparently had to split with his friend.<p/>

But Orange Kid proposed that he deserved a greater portion, since he was the one who came up with the idea in the first place. Of course, while acknowledging this, Apple Kid retorted that he was the one who made their invention work, and therefore it should be a 50-50 share of the dough. Orange Kid agreed with this, gave his buddy the $5000, and everything was well between them.<p/>

…That is, until both children woke up the next day to find their prize money missing. Orange and Apple Kid were wholly convinced that one had stolen the other’s money, and they had been holding the grudge with each other ever since. But who was the real culprit? Well, that one’s pretty obvious!<p/>



…Oh, yeah, and the machine was stolen, too.<p/>

What follows is THE TRUTH<p/>

Giygas and his Apple of Enlightenment predicted that there would be an "Apple Kid" integral to foiling his ultimate Universal domination. He used the Apple of Enlightenment to find the Kid.<p/>

Apple Kid lived in Twoson his whole life. He had an averseness to the mainstream and thus dropped out of school fairly early in life, preferring to educate himself. He was a kind lad, always thinking of others, to the point of neglecting taking proper care of himself. The locals thought of him as a slob, but nonetheless a clever one, so he had their respect.<p/>

In an attempt to unravel destiny, Giygas used his amazing technologies to manufacture a sort of evil clone of the Apple Kid, and named the result Orange Kid. Mere months before Ness was destined to find him, Orange Kid was sent to Twoson to sabotage him. Orange Kid was equally as intelligent as his nemesis, Apple, and was much more cleaned-up. He used his showy inventions to win over the town people and turn them against Apple Kid. Giygas had hoped to trick Ness into confiding in Orange Kid, who of course would prove utterly useless to him. Luckily, he did not succeed.<p/>

It was the second week of eighth grade, and the chubby boy had clearly made an enemy.<br/>
"Could someone tell me an example of a radioactive element?"<br/>
The chubby boy raised his hand to answer the question. Suddenly, a blond boy with glasses on the other side of the room blurted out without raising his hand, "Uranium!"<br/>
"Yes, blond boy with glasses, that is correct. Can someone give me another example?"<br/>
The chubby boy shouted, "Plutonium!"<br/>
"Chubby boy, you know the class rules. You can't answer a question without raising your hand! Go STRAIGHT to the principal's office!"<br/>
"What the hey?" he said.<br/>
"And I WON'T tolerate profanity! GET OUT!"<br/>
During the time in the office, the chubby boy plotted his revenge.<br/><br/>

Meanwhile, the lunch ladies at the school were receiving complaints about the apples and oranges served at lunch... they were leftovers from a horse ranch, but they were still edible by cafeteria standards.<br/><br/>

"Blond boy with the glasses!" shouted the chubby boy. "If you think you're so great on the subject of radioactivity, then why don't we see who can build the better nuclear reactor?"<br/>
"Bring it, chubby," he said, and pulled out the box of uranium that all teenage boys carry around. And they started building.<br/><br/>

"Goodbye, unfit fruit," said the cafeteria lady. "Don't do any funny business, like rolling into nuclear materials." She dumped the fruit down the declining street.<br/><br/>

The reactors were almost complete. "Eat trash, blondie!" shouted the chubby boy, and was told to "Take a shower, smelly!"<br/>
Suddenly a flood of oranges and apples came rolling down the road, and poured all into the machine!
"ERROR, ERROR, OVERHEAT!"<br/>
"What the hey!?!" shouted the chubby boy.<br/>
"ENOUGH!" Their teacher was approaching. "You CANNOT curse on school property! I realize it's not an actual curse, but I know what you meant, and..."<br/>
Before she could finish, the machines exploded and sent the two boys flying! They landed 3 hours later in a town named Twoson. The radioactive elements had a side effect on the two: a small portion of the apple and orange DNA was fused into the boys. They are known as "Apple Kid" and "Orange Kid" to this day.<br/><br/>

Orange Kid is the definition of cool. He can walk the walk, talk the talk, and other stuff the other stuff. His crystal clear eyes were the definition of cool. A self-proclaimed genius, women are shocked at his smooth-talking, his intelligence, and his boldness. Indeed, he was the definition of perfect throughout his years. But when and how did this rise to stardom begin? Here, we will examine this, on "Reach to the Stars: Orange Kid."<p/>

His rise to stardom began on his first day of school at the now renamed in his honor "Super Orange Tech" in Twoson. He was 8 at the time, and already he was showing signs of his current genius. He would boldly claim his intelligence, but he frequently got low grades, because he was too cool for homework and too cool to do his best on tests. The school officials, seeing his smarts, moved him ahead two grades.<p/>

Here, he began to obsess over his invention work. While his grades continued to fall, the school officials understood that they were nothing compared to his potential increase to the scientific community--he donned a persona, the Orange Kid, and began wearing only orange, attending school less and less. Some women loved his rebellious attitude, while others loved him for his wit, charm, and handsomeness, but one thing was clear: ladies loved him.<p/>

It wasn't long before he moved ahead yet another grade level, where he would meet his first rival. Uh... Tomato Kid? Er, Apple Kid, I mean. Apple Kid wasn't quite as brilliant as Orange Kid--while Orange Kid has brought otherworldly contributions to the world of science, such as the amazing "Orange Peeler," Apple Kid invented lame stuff nobody uses, like the Apple Computers we have today. While Apple Kid spends time trying to solve impossible issues, such as world hunger, Orange Kid puts his effort into working diligently for the convenience of the people of tomorrow.<p/>

Only time will tell what Orange Kid will bring to the scientific community, but a budding young sun like him will surely bring us closer to a utopian society. And when that happens, we'll be there to see it, here on "Reach to the Stars:Biographies" (only on the Discovery Channel).
--Discovery. The world is just awesome.<p/>
