<p>Over the years, many of Starmen.Net's most prominent article writers have written columns, with topics ranging as wide as EarthBound itself. Gradually I'll be reintroducing some of them to the site.</p>
<p>This week's "If you haven't read it, it's new to you" column: "Tomato's Mystical Travels", two articles about our nutritious webmaster's adventures in the mysterious, slightly off-putting world of Japan.</p>
<p>If you would like to write a column... well, I haven't quite figured out what I'm going to do about that. <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=usrinfo&id=307">Private message</a> me and we'll see what happens!</p>
