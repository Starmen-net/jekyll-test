Welcome to the Starmen.Net Articles and Theories section, where you can read seven years' worth of theories, editorials, and columns about everything from EarthBound to Starmen.Net. You can <a href="http://starmen.net/submit/?ForceSection=Articles">submit</a> an article about just about anything here. An article will be either an opinion article or a creative writing piece of your choice, relating to Starmen.net to Earthbound to anything loosely related to the two!<p></p>

There is also a weekly <a href="/articles/theories/index.php">Theories</a> contest! Every week we will give you a new topic based on something from the Mother series to respond to. You send us a theory about the subject using the <a href="http://starmen.net/submit/?ForceSection=Articles">submission form</a>, and we'll put it up with all the others to be read next week when we give the new topic! We'll show just about every submission, but try to keep something resembling quality and avoid any inappropriate subjects! If we REALLY like your submission, we will choose it to be the Theory of the Week, and throw it up on the front page along with the new prompt! Remember, silliness is encouraged, but don't hold back on submitting serious theories either! <p></p>

Submission rules for the Articles and Theories section are located <a href="http://starmen.net/articles/submissionrules.php">here</a>.<p></p>

If you have any questions at all, please PM the section maintainer, <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/members/J-Spade">J_Spade</a>.

<b>Q: What is the difference between Articles and Theories?</b><p/>

<b>Articles</b> is the whole section, covering editorial columns, opinion articles, short stories, creative writing projects, and general theories about the Mother series and the site at large. They can be about anything you want, as long as they don't break the <a href="/articles/submissionrules.php">rules</a>.<p/>

<b>Theories</b> is the name of the weekly prompt contest that you can enter. When submitting to Theories, only send me theories in regards to the current prompt. Do not send me theories in general. If you want to write outside the prompt, submit it to Articles.<p/>
<hr/><p/>

<b>Q: I wrote an article on another website. Can I submit it here?</b><p/>

Yes. You can submit the whole article here, but you cannot submit only a link to the other article. You must provide the entire content in the submission form.<p/>

<hr/><p/>

<b>Q: I have a question about the site. Do I ask it here?</b><p/>

<b>Q: I need help regarding the forum or other part of the site!</b><p/>

I'm sorry, but this is the wrong section. What you want to do is go <a href="/siteinfo/staff.php">here</a> and find the appropriate staffer, and contact him. Their forum profile will usually have an email on it if you can't PM them on the forums.
