<P><U>Question:</U><BR/>
<B>decaf mid ton spots nametag gums</B></P>

<p><U>Answer:</U><BR/>
The Moonside Sailor</p>

<p><img src="http://starmen.net/mother2/images/game/CaptainT.png" /></p>

<p><U>Explanation:</U><BR/>This is actually two riddles in one. Every word of the riddle is a "heteropalindrome", which means each has a different meaning if spelled backwards. The backwards words were the first clue that the riddle had to do with Moonside.</p>

<p>If you spell decaf mid ton spots nametag gums backwards you get, "smug gateman stops not dim faced". The Sailor who guards the Mani-Mani statue in Moonside will not let you through unless you have the invisible man with you. When you eventually bring him with you, the sailor says, "Huzzah! You really surprised me! You're the man whose eyebrows are connected and who has a gold tooth! How about we dump these kids and go get something to drink!?"</p>
