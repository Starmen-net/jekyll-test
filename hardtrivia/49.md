<P><U>Question:</U><BR/>
<B> A link to your patronage; an enabler of burdens.</B></P>

<p><U>Answer:</U><BR/>
Mr. Saturn ATM</p>

<p><img src="http://starmen.net/mother2/images/game/MrSaturnATMT.png" /></p>

<p><U>Explanation:</U><BR/>An ATM is the link to your patronage (your dad being your patron, and his money being your patronage). A shop in Saturn Valley refers to each item you purchase as a "burden", which is the only place in the game that does that. The ATM does not actually <i>give</i> you any "burdens", but it does enable you to receive them.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, nobody actually guessed this one. There were many submissions that were <i>very very</i> close, but didn't exactly fit. However the guesses "ATM" and "ATM Card" were so close (and arguably correct), that I'll go ahead and accept them anyway. Congrats! :D</p>
