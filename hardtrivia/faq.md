<p><b>Q:</b> What is Plo's HARD Trivia?<br/>
<b>A:</b> It's a riddle based trivia game for EarthBound that I started it back in 1999. It began when reidman would use his IRC script called "AutoEB" to conduct trivia sessions in #earthbound. He'd ask simple trivia questions, but unfortunately the winners were usually decided by whoever could type the fastest and/or had the best internet connection. Being a crummy typer on AOL, I didn't fare so well. I decided to start another trivia game that would be slow, difficult, and would create long pauses of contemplation instead of frantic keyboard racing. It was on Starmen.Net for a long time, then it wasn't, and now it is again! Yay!</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> How do I play?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Read the current riddle, think about what it could be referring to from EarthBound, and submit your answer. The answer will either be a person, place, or thing (and is usually pretty esoteric).</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Does it involve all of the MOTHER games, or just EarthBound?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Currently just EarthBound (MOTHER 2), so you'll be swingin' at the wind if you make MOTHER 1 or MOTHER 3 based submissions.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> How often is it updated?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Once a week, probably on Friday or Sunday (or maybe even Funday).</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Can I submit multiple answers?<br/>
<b>A:</b> No, only once a week. If you guess multiple times, only your most recent one will be valid, so make it count.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What if I submit two answers in one submission? (two answers at the same time)<br/>
<b>A:</b> Then your submission becomes invalid. Don't do it!</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Do I have to spell everything "coorectly"?<br/>
<b>A:</b> You don't HAVE to, but I would appreciate correct spelling. It still has to be understandable to be valid.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What if I give a vague answer like "Antoid"?<br/>
<b>A:</b> You have to be specific and say either "Black Antoid" or "Red Antoid". No blanket answers will be accepted.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What if I guess something that fits perfectly with the riddle, but wasn't what the answer was?<br/>
<b>A:</b> I'll consider each answer, and will accept alternate answers if I think they fit perfectly with the riddle. Riddles can be fairly subjective, but I'll do my best to be fair.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What if I guess wrong?<br/>
<b>A:</b> You hit yourself with the SPoD.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What if I guess right?<br/>
<b>A:</b> You get 1 point.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What do these points do?<br/>
<b>A:</b> 5 points gets you a green PHT badge, 10 points gets you a red PHT badge and a forum rank, 15 points gets you a blue PHT badge and a forum avatar, and 20 points gets you a purple PHT badge.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Where can I keep track of my points?<br/>
<b>A:</b> You can see them in the <a href="hof.php">Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Can I give points or rewards to someone else?<br/>
<b>A:</b> nope.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Can I have a group discussion on the forum about what I think the answer is?<br/>
<b>A:</b> NO WAY!</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Where can I see the answer to the previous riddle?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Below the current question, you'll see a list of the previous riddles. Check em' out!</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Can I come up with a riddle for you?<br/>
<b>A:</b> Sure, but I won't use it. I'll only use riddles I come up with myself.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> If the answer to last week's riddle was "Worthless Protoplasm", will it never be the answer again?<br/>
<b>A:</b> It could be; I'll occasionally re-use previous answers in different riddles.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Why does it tell me to log in?<br/>
<b>A:</b> You have to be <a href="http://forum.starmen.net">logged into the forum</a> to submit an answer.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> PLO UPDATE HARD TRIVIA!!!<br/>
<b>A:</b> THAT'S NOT A QUESTION!</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What if I have a question that's not listed here?<br/>
