<P><U>Question:</U><BR/>
<B>Burning or freezing, with cackles of frustration,
<br>a night reclaimed and later days, self condemnation.</br></B></P>

<p><U>Answer:</U><BR/>
Twoson Hotel Businessman, Urban Zombie, and Dept. Store Spook</p>

<p><U>Explanation:</U><BR/> The Businessman in the Twoson Hotel will say seemingly random things if you repeatedly talk to him.<br/></p>

<p><I>Burning or freezing,</I>: He tells you "Is it cold today?" and "It's sooo hot today."</p>

<p><I>with cackles of frustration,</I>: A "cackle" is a laugh with a harsh connotation. The Businessman tells you: "Ah! Hah Hahhhh..." and "You're annoying!"</p>

<p><I>a night reclaimed</I>: If you continue to talk to him, he will eventually give you $50 "Here, get yourself a juice or something... *Ka-ching* (Ness got 50 dollars.)" $50 is also how much it costs to stay at the Twoson Hotel, so you had reclaimed the money you had spent to stay the night.</p>

<P><I>and later days,</I>: Another quote he has is, "Later days, pal!" Incidentally Tomato also snuck this quote into the translated subtitles of a Dragonball DVD.</P>

<p><I>self condemnation.</I>: Another (quite bizarre) quote he says is, "Dang me!"</p>

<p>There were some other great guesses like Brickroad and Starman Junior, but they didn't <I>quite</I> fit. Neither had "cackles" of frustration, and a "night reclaimed and later days" became a bit of a stretch. Excellent guessing regardless! After <A HREF="http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Site/Newsroom/406024668/page/1#post1859562">discussing it on the forum</A>, I've also decided to accept Urban Zombie and Dept. Store Spook as well.</p>
