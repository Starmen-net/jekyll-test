We have a huge sprite database and we thought it would be cool to have a new sprite appear on the main page everyday with a funky little quote next to it.<br /><br />

reidman, guruzeth, SimonBob, Falcon24, and several other staffers went through and wrote a description for each one.  Tokage and TheMadCreator wrote the code that generates the sprite and description.
