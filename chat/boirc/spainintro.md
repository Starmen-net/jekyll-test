Tomato got bored early one morning (or late one night, by his standards), and went into #starmen as "LilUFO", pretending to be a kid from Spain who couldn't speak English very well. The people in #starmen (except for Loco-san) were so easily fooled that it made it hilarious as Tomato talked in broken English and Ness3 thought he was falling for a Spanish girl.
