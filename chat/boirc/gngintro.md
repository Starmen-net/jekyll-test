In case you weren't introduced to it when you were a child, "Highlights" is a magazine for young kids. In this small magazine, there are lots of "fun games for you to play" and too many educational stories to be believed. One of the "Good/Bad" cartoons is called 'Goofus and Gallant'.

Of course, reidman had to edit that picture a little bit, but you get the general idea. Goofus is always a bad boy, and Gallant is always brave, wise, trustworthy, and sickeningly good.

Anyways, this little comic sparked a rather hilarious discussion between reidman and EBounding which lasted at least 15 minutes. Enjoy!
