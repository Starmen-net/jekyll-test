<p>
The Best of IRC is comprised of, as you would guess, chat logs from IRC from the most memorable moments in #earthbound or Starmen.net's other affiliated channels!  The Chat section lacked attention in 2002-2005 after work on it stopped, thus leaving no chance of further BoIRC submissions. </p>

BUT THEN, BOZO DESCENDED IN A CHARIOT OF LIGHT, SAYING, "<a href="http://forum.starmen.net/members/Captain-Bozo">Send me your quotes from affiliated channels via PM</a>, and I will put them on the new <b>BoIRC 4.0: Oh No, It's IRC!</b>"<p/>

AND IT WAS GOOD.
