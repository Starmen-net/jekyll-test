The quotes you read in BoIRC 3.0 are mainly compiled by the OPs in those channels, but we'll always welcome some help! If there's something hilarious that happened in either #earthbound, #radiopsi, or #pkhax and you caught it, send it in! You can PM it <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=ppost&toi=70">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Don't think these lines are all that funny? It's your own fault! <a href="http://starmen.net/chat/getconnected.php">Get connected</a> and join in on the fun.
