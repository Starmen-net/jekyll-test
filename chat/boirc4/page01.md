[17:41:55] &lt@MrAccident&gt welp<br/>
[17:42:10] &lt@MrAccident&gt today I bought a sofa and nearly shot a man<br/>
[17:42:46] &lt@MrAccident&gt the two events were not directly related<br/>
[17:43:13] &lt@MrAccident&gt it was just twenty minutes ago actually<br/>
[17:43:18] &lt@MrAccident&gt my heart is still pounding a little<br/>
[17:44:28] &lt@MrAccident&gt I was on the bus and there was this guy in the back who had apparently been harassing this woman<br/>
[17:45:15] &lt@MrAccident&gt there were increasingly loud shouts of "shut the &ltexpletive&gt up" and "get the &ltexpletive&gt away from me"<br/>
[17:45:30] &lt@MrAccident&gt he was in the middle of the back seat and she was sort of in the corner, so she couldn't move easily<br/>
[17:45:58] &lt@MrAccident&gt I got up and told him to get out of the way so she could change seats, which he did eventually<br/>
[17:46:32] &lt@MrAccident&gt she moved to one of the seats in the articulated section<br/>
[17:46:49] &lt@MrAccident&gt the man appeared to be both mentally unstable and drunk<br/>
[17:47:18] &lt@MrAccident&gt he had a bucket that appeared to contain a mop head, a few squeegees, and several bottles of cleaning solutions<br/>
[17:47:32] &lt@MrAccident&gt but one of the bottles had a bright orange liquid in it and he was drinking from it -_-<br/>
[17:48:01] &lt@MrAccident&gt anyway, just a few moments after the woman moved to another seat, the guy got up shouting something about how he had paid his fare and could sit wherever he liked<br/>
[17:48:09] &lt@MrAccident&gt and he moved down and took a seat just across from her<br/>
[17:48:26] &lt@MrAccident&gt so she's starting to flip out just a little<br/>
[17:48:49] &lt@MrAccident&gt at that point I get up and stand between them and tell him he needs to move back where he was or get off the bus<br/>
[17:49:10] &lt@MrAccident&gt and then another guy comes in from the other end of the bus and tells him the same thing<br/>
[17:49:24] &lt@MrAccident&gt only he tells it a lot better, because he has a voice like a marine drill sergeant<br/>
[17:50:07] &lt@MrAccident&gt then the drunk guy starts getting belligerent and puts his hand inside his coat like he's reaching for a weapon<br/>
[17:50:20] &lt@MrAccident&gt that's where it all gets a little fuzzy<br/>
[17:51:10] &lt@MrAccident&gt I reach down and put my coat aside, put my hand on my 1911, and flip the safety off<br/>
[17:51:35] &lt@MrAccident&gt then I repeat my earlier suggestion<br/>
[17:51:39] &lt@MrAccident&gt still too quietly probably<br/>
[17:51:44] &lt@MrAccident&gt I'm not used to raising my voice XD<br/>
[17:52:17] &lt@MrAccident&gt in most sane people this action probably would have led to a hasty exist<br/>
[17:52:20] &lt@MrAccident&gt exit, even<br/>
[17:52:55] &lt@MrAccident&gt but this guy is drunk and unstable and frankly, standing 3 feet away from him on a crowded bus, I'm not sure what I should have done if he suddenly did become violent<br/>
[17:53:24] &lt@MrAccident&gt he makes another grab for his coat and somewhere in the back of my head I'm wondering if this is where it all goes downhill<br/>
[17:53:45] &lt@MrAccident&gt fortunately mr. drill sergeant is still there and physically grabs his hand and pulls it away, telling him "not to try any of that &ltexpletive&gt"<br/>
[17:54:19] &lt@MrAccident&gt we're both telling him he just needs to get off the bus or we're going to call the police<br/>
[17:54:47] &lt@MrAccident&gt then he finally seems to see sense, and begins moving to the front of the bus<br/>
[17:55:03] &lt@MrAccident&gt at the exit though he seems to have second thoughts and starts getting belligerent again<br/>
[17:55:14] &lt@MrAccident&gt and it was here that the day was saved by an unlikely hero<br/>
[17:55:39] &lt@MrAccident&gt this really old kindly black guy I'd been sitting next to back when it all started<br/>
[17:55:59] &lt@MrAccident&gt gets up, walks all the way to the front, pushes between me and mr. drill sergeant, and starts pleading with this guy to just go<br/>
[17:56:12] &lt@MrAccident&gt physically blocks him from getting back inside the coach<br/>
[17:56:20] &lt@MrAccident&gt and finally gets him off so that the bus driver can close the doors<br/>
[17:57:17] &lt@MrAccident&gt I made sure I shook his hand before my stop<br/>
[17:57:19] &lt@Emily&gt And then the lady he was bothering went back to your place, right? She's standing behind you giving you a shoulder massage right now, isn't she?<br/>
[17:57:19] &lt@MrAccident&gt that guy was legit<br/>

[16:35:30] &ltStevesesy&gt Its pretty ridiculou<br/>
[16:36:52] &ltStevesesy&gt I'm trying to think of what today's ridic minute was<br/>
[16:36:59] &ltPsiReaper&gt That would be me entering this IRC<br/>
[16:37:01] &ltStevesesy&gt I think it was when I went to work and had to fix the toilet<br/>
[16:37:04] &ltStevesesy&gt no<br/>
[16:37:08] &ltStevesesy&gt it was lunch<br/>
[16:37:08] &ltPsiReaper&gt Darn.<br/>
[16:37:13] &ltStevesesy&gt I had lunch with a wizard<br/>
[16:37:16] &ltStevesesy&gt yeah<br/>
[16:37:16] &lt@BuckFever&gt lunch while fixing the toilet<br/>
[16:37:20] &lt@BuckFever&gt with a wizard<br/>
[16:37:23] &lt@BuckFever&gt taking a wizz<br/>
[16:37:33] &ltStevesesy&gt :I<br/>
[16:37:43] &ltPsiReaper&gt Sounds legit.<br/>
[16:38:15] &ltArlin&gt Did he put on his robe and wizard hat?<br/>
[16:38:17] &ltStevesesy&gt No like the guy was incarcerated for like 3 days<br/>
[16:38:35] &ltStevesesy&gt cause he got up in front of his university's student senate and read a poem<br/>
[16:38:46] &ltStevesesy&gt so they put him away for a psyche eval<br/>
[16:39:21] &ltStevesesy&gt We got lunch<br/>
[16:39:23] &ltStevesesy&gt talked<br/>
[16:39:27] &ltStevesesy&gt went for a walk<br/>
[16:39:35] &ltStevesesy&gt he told me about how portlania was the best tv show<br/>

[20:16:41] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt Those polar bears look so crazy in 3D<br/>
[20:16:48] &lt@HockeyKong&gt Who here has Harvest moon Barn Raising?<br/>
[20:16:50] &ltAceDrgnGirl&gt ...<br/>
[20:16:51] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt and the way they implemented temperture play<br/>
[20:16:56] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt _classic_<br/>
[20:17:06] &ltAceDrgnGirl&gt Bozo, stop it. You're making it seem like that's a real thing.<br/>
[20:17:13] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt It is a real thing Ace :&lt<br/>
[20:17:24] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt If you play in the sun, the game gets easier, but you get less points<br/>
[20:17:31] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt but if you play while sitting inside of a meat locker or something<br/>
[20:17:33] &ltAceDrgnGirl&gt I'm gonna google it and if I don't get any results<br/>
[20:17:37] &ltAceDrgnGirl&gt I'm gonna be all upset and stuff<br/>
[20:17:44] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt the game gets crazy hard, but you get all of the points<br/>
[20:17:55] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt Hockey and I occasionally play online<br/>
[20:18:04] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt I make him play in a fridge<br/>
[20:18:12] &lt@Tofu&gt the other day i was playing excitebike fastracing<br/>
[20:18:19] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt I didn't get that one<br/>
[20:18:21] &ltAceDrgnGirl&gt you guys are mean<br/>
[20:18:23] &lt@Tofu&gt it's such a blatant cash grab<br/>
[20:18:26] &lt@HockeyKong&gt I'm always Popo<br/>
[20:18:31] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt hey<br/>
[20:18:33] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt I look good in pink<br/>
[20:18:35] &ltDr_Meowgon_Spengler&gt I'll raise you a barn<br/>
[20:18:58] &lt@Tofu&gt how would one raised in a barn raise someone in a barn<br/>
[20:19:40] &lt!Captain_Bozo&gt I hear you can unlock Ness if you jump off the cliff in level 17 though<br/>
[20:20:45] &lt@HockeyKong&gt Yeah, and then you slide along the wall until you fall through a hole in the graphics and you can fight Gruntilda ealy
