The Writing section is your chance to submit scary scripts, spooky stories, and possessed poetry to raise the hair on the back of your reader's necks. Your words can work weird witchcraft, after all - what are spells but the right words in the right order? Submit your writing by November 5th to be considered to win one of our prizes. There's ample opportunity for horror in the mind's eye, and the imagination of the audience can conjure images impossible to render in any other media. Don't delve too deeply. The Devil's in the details in more way than one.<p/>

So I decided to write a poem about Osohe Castle, and I attempted a Shakespearean sonnet with this one. It's a bit subtle that it's about Osohe Castle, but that's mainly because I did this as part of a school assignment and I don't think many people at school would appreciate a totally blatant Mother 3 poem.
