Welcome to Starmen.net's 2012 Summer Bootcamp archives! What better time to improve your art skills than in the summer when you're jobless, schoolless, and twiddling your thumbs in boredom!? Over the course of several weeks, select artists taught lessons on their area of expertise and challenged the community to use what they've newly learned to create pieces of art. Here is where you will find an archive of those lessons and the resulting products.
