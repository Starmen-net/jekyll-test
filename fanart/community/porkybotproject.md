From the brilliant mind of one of Starmen.net's greatest artists, comic artist, and cartoonist, SaturnStorm, comes a new and exciting project that hailed lots of participation and contribution!
<br>
<br>
"As collaborative projects have risen in popularity, I figured I’d direct people towards something Mother related, with an easygoing deadline. Thus, the Porky-Bot project was born!

The guidelines weren’t all typical of the past collab projects — no backgrounds, and no colour — but people rose to that splendidly, presenting a wide range of differing Porky-bots in all forms of greyscale. Many of them were new to the idea, and had been previously intimidated by the long-standing artists of the site. But seeing what they were all able to accomplish here — all 34 of them — it’s safe to say they should all be proud of these results." </br></br>
