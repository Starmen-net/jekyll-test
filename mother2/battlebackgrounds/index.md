While many RPG's at the time had rather simplistic backgrounds during fights, EarthBound stood out from the others. The trippy animated sequences were quite memorable and still are acknowledged to this day. <br /><br />

You can download these backgrounds below, though they are not limited to battles, but any animated background sequence. Do keep in mind, these are not animated, so they are not 100% accurate to the game.
