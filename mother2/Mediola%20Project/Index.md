This is the Mediola Project.

Each week, I will take the best from three categories and post them here.  The categories are:

Best Screenie
Best Glitched Screenie/Movie
Best Movie

A Screenie is a screenshot, a glitched movie/screenie is a glitch found in the game with the WTW code or other method, and a movie is a video file of the game.

You may submit your media <a href="http://www.starmen.net/submit/">here.</a>

Submit them to Earthbound / Mother 2: Eartbound Mediola Project
Video must be in WMV, MPG, or ZSNES Video format.
