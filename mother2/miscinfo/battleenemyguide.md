<div align="justify">
Hiya!  Welcome to my Battle and Enemy Guide for EarthBound, the wacky, 
madcap RPG for the Super NES.
<br /> <br />
Why did I make a guide like this?  Well, a lot of people have complete 
walkthroughs, so I felt we didn't need another.  Then I noticed that 
even the most detailed walkthroughs have very bare-bones enemy coverage.  
Most just copied right out of the guide and left it at that.  I felt 
we all need more explanation.  I extended this from a simple guide to 
encompassing the entire battle system to further expound on general 
strategies.</div>

This section covers the basics of battle.
<hr width="50" align="left" />
Engaging an Enemy
<br /> <br />
There aren't many places in the game where your completely safe.  Even 
in some towns, there are enemies wandering around.  You'll know them 
by a few tell-tale signs.  One: they look rather out of place.  Two: 
They move really fast; regular NPCs don't move fast at all.  Three: 
They'll charge you.
<br /> <br />
When you walk up to an enemy, you'll see a swirl and battle will begin.  
If you and the enemy are facing each other (or the side), you'll see a 
gray swirl and battle will begin as normal.  If you get an enemy from 
behind, you'll see a green swirl and you'll get a turn of battle without 
the enemy retaliating.  If an enemy gets you from behind, however, 
it'll get an opening attack.
<br /> <br />
There are times that you'll engage an enemy and will automatically 
defeat it.  This occurs when your party is strong and fast enough to 
beat an enemy before it has a chance to attack.  This is a nice 
convenient way to defeat weak enemies.
<br /> <br />
Also, you may have times when enemies run away from you instead of 
charging.  The most common place for this to happen is in caves that 
lead to Your Sanctuaries after you beat the main enemy, but this can 
also happen if you get a significant amount of above enemies in the 
area.
<hr width="50" align="left" />

In a Battle
<br /> <br />
Once engaged in battle, the enemy will appear on the screen (with a 
funky background).  Your party's Status Windows will appear at the 
bottom, and the Command and Info Windows show up at the top.
<br /> <br />
The Status Windows show your each party member's current HP, PP, and 
any status ailments they might have.
<br /> <br />
The Command Window allows you to select how your party members will act 
when the turn comes up.
<br /> <br />
Info Windows pop up when something happens in battle (since there 
aren't many animations).
<br /> <br />
You'll start by selecting how you wish to act during the turn.  Once 
all characters have selected, the turn begins, with the fastest 
combatant going first, then so on, until everyone takes their turn.
<hr width="50" align="left" />

Battle Commands
<br /> <br />
Bash/Shoot: These are your basic attack commands.  Your character will 
use the weapon he/she's equipped with at the moment and attack the enemy 
you tell him/her to.
<br /> <br />
PSI: Ness, Paula, and Poo have the special gift of employing 
psychokinetic abilities in battle.  When this is selected, you'll open 
another menu where you can select a PSI to use.
<br /> <br />
Goods: This will open up your Inventory Window, where you can use one 
of the items you are currently carrying in battle.
<br /> <br />
Defend: This will put up your defenses for a round, whereby you'll take 
less damage from direct attacks.
<br /> <br />
Pray: An ability unique to Paula.  When Paula prays, mysterious things 
happen.  It's not worth going into her praying outcomes here, but 
things that can happen include HP restoration, status ailments to all 
parties, and rarely stuff like PP restoration or battle starting over.
<br /> <br />
Spy: An ability unique to Jeff.  Jeff uses his intuition to scope out an 
enemy.  He'll report back with the enemy's Offense, Defense, and any 
weakness to PSI it might have.
<br /> <br />
Mirror: An ability unique to Poo.  This ability has a different chance 
of working dependent on the enemy.  Poo can use his amazing 
concentration to assume the form of one of the enemies in the current 
battle.  Once this happens, you lose control of him, and he attacks on 
his own, using the enemy's attacks.  If he uses PSI, PP are deducted as 
normal.
<br /> <br />
Auto Fight: Whoever is the first person active gets this ability, 
usually Ness.  This will let the fight go without your input.  Your 
characters will attack a random enemy and battle will continue until 
you press B to halt Auto Fight, or the battle's over one way or the 
other.  If a character is heavily damaged HP-wise, usually around 20% 
remaining, anyone who has Lifeup will use the highest ability they 
have (even if it's not necessary).  If a character suffers status 
ailments, anyone who has Healing will use the most cost-effective 
Heal.

Run Away: You take a chance to try to run off.  You have a different 
chance of running depending on the enemies.  If you fail to run, your 
enemy takes a free round.

<hr width="50" align="left" />

Status Ailments
<br /><br />
Hold: This is a situation where you cannot move or are "solidified".  
You cannot perform any actions except PSI, Pray, Spy, or Mirror.  You 
should return to normal after one round, but on rare occasions, you'll 
be frozen for more than one round.  Turns the area around your name a 
solid purple.
<br /> <br />
Cold: You have a runny and sniffly nose and will lose about 5 HP per 
round of battle.  Cured by at least Healing Alpha, a Cold Serum, a 
Refreshing Herb or something stronger, or seeing a Doctor, Dr. Saturn, 
or using hot springs.  Shows up as a runny nose on your Status Window.  
You'll also see red flashes in the field indicating your loss of HP.
<br /> <br />
Sunstroke: The sun is too much for you and you lose about 5 HP per 
round of battle.  Cured by at least Healing Alpha, a Wet Towel, a 
Refreshing Herb or something stronger, or seeing a Doctor, Dr. Saturn, 
or using hot springs.  Shows up as a sun on your Status Window.  You'll 
also see red flashes in the field indicating your loss of HP.
<br /> <br />
Sleep: An enemy has lulled you to sleep, and you'll be out for the 
next round.  There's a chance of waking up the next round, but it's not 
guaranteed.  Also, if you get hit, there'll be a chance you wake up.  
Cures automatically after battle, or with at least Healing Alpha, a 
Refreshing Herb, or something stronger.  Shows up as Z's in your Status 
Window.
<br /> <br />
Lose Concentration: You can still think and act rationally, but you 
lose your focus and can't use PSI.  Cures after a few turns, or after 
battle.  Your PP window is X-ed out while this is in effect.
<br /> <br />
Poison: You're filled with horrible poison and will lose about 20 HP 
per round of battle.  Cured by at least Healing Beta, a Vial of Serum, 
a Refreshing Herb or something stronger, or seeing a Doctor, Dr. Saturn, 
or using hot springs.  Shows up as a skull and crossbones in your 
Status Window.  You'll also see red flashes in the field indicating 
your loss of HP.
<br /> <br />
Crying: You're blinded by your own tears and your ability to hit 
enemies goes way down.  Cured automatically after battle, or with at 
least Healing Beta, a Refreshing Herb, or something stronger.  Shows up 
as an eye with a tear in your Status Window.
<br /> <br />
Nausea: You feel sick to your stomach and will lose about 20 HP per 
round of battle.  Cured by at least Healing Beta, a Refreshing Herb or 
something stronger, or seeing a Doctor, Dr. Saturn, or using hot 
springs.  Shows up as a frown with X-ed eyes in your Status Window.  
You'll see your character sweating and red flashes in the field, 
indicating your loss of HP.
<br /> <br />
Feeling Strange: You cannot focus and may attack your friends or 
enemies alike.  Cured automatically after battle, or with at least 
Healing Beta, a Refreshing Herb, or something stronger.  Shows up as a 
weird swirl in your Status Window.
<br /> <br />
Numbness: You become paralyzed and cannot move.  You can't perform 
any actions except PSI, Pray, Spy, or Mirror.  Cured by at least 
Healing Gamma, a Secret Herb or something stronger, or seeing a Healer, 
Dr. Saturn, or using hot springs.  Shows up as zigzag lines in your 
Status Window.  You will also with very slow frames in the field.
<br /> <br />
Diamondized: The carbon in your body condenses and you become as hard 
as a diamond, and cannot do anything.  Cured by at least Healing Gamma, 
a Secret Herb or something stronger, or seeing a Healer, Dr. Saturn, or 
using hot springs.  Shows up as a diamond in your Status Window, and 
turns your window borders red.  In the field, you will appear to be a 
person made out of diamond.
<br /> <br />
Mashroomized: A mushroom sprouts from your head.  After a few rounds, 
you will not be able to focus and may attack your friends and enemies 
alike.  Cured by visiting a Healer, a girl collecting mushrooms, Dr. 
Saturn, or using hot springs.  Shows up as a mushroom in your Status 
Window.  In the field, you'll see the mushroom on your head, and soon, 
you won't be able to walk straight.
<br /> <br />
Possession: A ghost haunts you.  Every round of battle, it'll either 
attack for 1 HP of damage, or use its icy hand to solidify you for a 
round.  Cured by visiting a Healer, Dr. Saturn, or using hot springs.  
In the field, you'll see a ghost floating around you.
<br /> <br />
Unconsciousness: When you get hit for mortal damage, you HP will roll 
to zero.  If you can heal yourself before you get to zero, you'll be 
all right, but if you don't, you'll pass out and the window borders 
will turn red.  You can be revived by at least Healing Gamma, a Secret 
Herb or something stronger, visiting a Nurse, or Dr. Saturn.  In the 
field, the affected character will be a transparent ghost.
<br /> <br />
Homesickness: Only Ness can be afflicted with this, and it happens 
randomly and without warning.  Once Ness's turn comes around, he'll 
waste a turn thinking about home, his mom, or his favorite food.  When 
this happens, the only cure is to call home to Mom.
