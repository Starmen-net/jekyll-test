Only the ultimate MOTHER 2/EB fans know this stuff... so learn it! There'll be a test on it at the end of the semester!

<ul>
 <li>Two players can play the game together! Just plug in two controllers! It's not that useful or anything, but it's neat!</li>

 <br /><br />
 <li>MOTHER 2 / EarthBound can be played entirely with one hand. The L button is a shortcut for Check/Talk/Accept, and the Select button acts the same as the B button. To bring up the main menu outside, press Select and then L.</li>

 <br /><br />
 <li>The mysterious <a href="images/voices.png">"M.D. Seeger"</a>, who is credited with the rock guitar on the gas station screen right before the main title screen, is none other than Shigeru Miyamoto himself. But weirdest of all, apparently Miyamoto might not even realize that he had been made into this mysterious foreign guitarist.</li>

 <br /><br />
 <li>When you finish typing your names and hit OK, a tiny clip saying, "OK desu ka?" ("OK?") plays. This is Shigesato Itoi's voice, and apparently the sound designers added this in at the last second, without Mr. Itoi's knowledge. The clip was also recorded when Mr. Itoi didn't realize he was being recorded, so he was very surprised when he eventually heard it in-game.</li>

 <br /><br />
 <li>Itoi wasn't responsible for Moonside's creation. That was one of the locations he let his assistants have free reign. The art director Kouichi Ooyama made some interesting artwork for it, an assistant writer Akihito Toda had a good idea to go along with it and wrote some pretty unusual lines of dialogue, and game musician Hirokazu Tanaka created some music that fit with their work.</li>

</ul>
