EarthBound's text is very complicated, and there are lots of programming "control codes" in it. So EarthBound text dumps usually aren't very pretty. In any case, here are the current text dumps as made by Tomato on June 22, 2007.

<ul>
 <li><a href="script.txt">EarthBound Script</a> - (1.0 MB, .txt)</li>
 <li><a href="script.htm">EarthBound Script (without control codes)</a> - (632 KB, .htm)</li>
</ul>

There are still a few lines of text missing, but nothing from the main script itself. These files also include the names of items, enemies, etc., as well as item descriptions, menus, and many other things. If there's any text in EarthBound you want to look up, these files probably have it!
