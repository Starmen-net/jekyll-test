		Prince Zuko is a character from a Nickelodeon show called <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>.  Zuko is a banished prince from the Fire Nation - that scar on his face is the result of a duel gone wrong. In addition to looking similar to each other, both characters are highly trained in their country's national disciplines (Poo is trained in Mu and Zuko is trained in Firebending), and both are physically-fit martial artists.
