Ness doesn’t come from a long line of warrior knights, he isn’t the last of any ancient dragon clans either, heck, he can’t even use a sword!  What kind of RPG protagonist is this!?  Ness is just your average everyday kid from Eagleland living a quiet life in the northern hills of Onett with his Mother, Sister Tracy, and his dog, King.  However, when a meteor carrying a messenger from ten years in the future lands in his backyard he is charged with the duty of saving the Earth from the Universal Cosmic Destroyer, Giygas.  That sure is a lot of responsibility for someone who isn’t even old enough to drive!  Luckily, Ness does have some powerful psychic powers that will surely prove useful along his journey.<br />
<br />
Being a silent protagonist, it is difficult to get an understanding of just what kind of person Ness is, but if it’s true that actions speak louder than words then he is certainly deserving of his “hero” title.  Along his way he will reform a dangerous street gang, rescue a kidnapped girl from a crazed cult, rid a town of their zombie problem, and reunite a man with his lost contact lens…  Ok, that last one wasn’t very harrowing but that’s not even scratching the surface!<br />
<br />
Compared to the other members of the chosen four, Ness is the strongest in many aspects from offense to vitality.  With his trusty baseball bat he’ll definitely be able to deal out some serious damage as well as absorbing quite a few hits himself before needing to heal.  In addition to his physical prowess, Ness has a lot of useful psychic skills, such as the HP replenishing “Lifeup” ability and the devastating PSI Rockin’ power, one of the most powerful offensive attacks in the game.</p><br />

<b><u>Paula:</u></b>

</div>
Paula is the psychic powerhouse of the team but you probably wouldn’t expect that coming from a teenage preschool aide.  Paula is a native of Twoson, the second town on our hero’s journey.  She lives with her Mother and Father in their home that also serves as a day-care for young children known as the Polestar Preschool.  She is very well liked by all of the children there and some even claim they want to be “juuuusst like Paula” when they grow up.  Paula is also quite the celebrity in her hometown.  Because of her psychic prowess she’s the subject of a lot of talk in Twoson and reporters constantly visit her home in the hopes of getting an interview with such a wunderkind.<br />
<br />
Although she is quick with a bash from her non-stick fry pan, her real strength lies in her psychokinetic powers.  Paula’s psychic battery is the most one of the most extensive in the game.  For offensive abilities she has three powerful elemental PSIs, fire, freeze and thunder. “Well, if she’s the female magic user than she must have a lot of healing spells right?” NOPE!  Not in EarthBound anyway, we don’t stick to those tired character archetypes.  The only recovery ability she has is PSI magnet that allows her to take away psychic points from enemies and use them herself.<br /> 
<br />
Out of battle, Paula’s psychic abilities are able to help out Ness and co. as well.  She was able to speak to Ness via telepathy during his journey to Twoson in order to let him know where to find her. Another unique ability of hers is the pray command.  When used in battle, a prayer can sometimes turn a hopeless situation into a stunning victory by making an enemy feel strange or by  healing the entire party if you’re lucky.

</div>
Jeff Andonuts hails from the northern country of Winters.  He spends his days within the stately walls of the Snowwood Boarding School, until one night he is woken by a telepathic call that urges him to travel south.  Against the wishes of his eccentric roommate Tony he heeds the call and ventures out into the dimly lit forests.  Although they haven’t seen each other in over a decade, the only family Jeff possesses is his Father, the famous Dr. Andonuts.  When Jeff comes upon his lab during his southbound trek the family reunion is short as Dr. Andonuts quickly ushers him into his homemade flying saucer, the Sky Runner, and sets the coordinates for Threed where our two heroes are being held captive.<br />
<br />
Jeff is a character with hardly any bark, but a lot of bite.  He’s self-admittedly shy, pretty quiet, and doesn’t have any of the psychic abilities of the other party members but he makes up for it with his unparalleled mechanical genius and big guns.  Although he can’t use psychic attacks, he has access to a large number of weapon items that no one else can handle.  Such items include bottle rockets, bazookas, HP suckers, and laser guns.  In addition to being able to operate these heavy munitions, Jeff also has the ability to fix certain broken items you will come across during your adventure.  Depending on his IQ stat during certain sleeping sequences Jeff will work through the night to repair an item.  These fixed items cannot be purchased in any shops and often have very powerful and unique effects.  Who needs PSI Fire when you have a Death Ray?<br />
<br />
During battle Jeff has the exclusive ability to spy on an enemy.  The spy command allows Jeff to determine many of the opponent’s physical statistics (such as offense and defense) as well as any weaknesses it might have to certain PSI attacks.  This ability is especially useful if you’re fighting something you’ve never faced before and you don’t want to waste your psychic points finding out its weakness on your own.  If he’s lucky, Jeff might even find an item the enemy was hiding and immediately add it to his inventory.</p><br />

</div>
Our final hero is the esteemed Prince Poo of Dalaam.  He makes his home in the Dalaamese Palace with his master and royal attendants but most of his time is spent performing his arduous Mu training.  Adored by women and respected by men, Poo is the epitome of royal grace and tact and is always willing to lend a hand or a fist to help out.  Poo’s lifelong Mu training has hardened his body and strengthened his mind making him one of the most powerful members of the chosen four.  An impressive blend of martial arts mastery and potent psychic ability, Poo is a welcomed addition when his master tells him to join Ness and the others in their quest to defeat Giygas.<br />
<br />
Poo has a number of interesting attributes that are exclusive to his character when he joins the party.  For one thing he doesn’t regain HP or PP from food items like the other three.  Since he was raised in an area with very different culinary techniques, Poo doesn’t enjoy western food all that much and therefore only gains a small amount of HP when he eats it.  However, there are a few food items that are especially beneficial to him.  For example, a brain food lunch will completely recover both Poo’s HP and PP and a bottle of DX water can replenish up to 40 psychic points whereas Ness or Paula would only gain 1 PP from its use.  Another exclusive facet is his mysterious power to mirror an enemy during battle.  Supposedly learned during his Mu training, Poo has the ability to take a deep breath and assume the form of an opponent.  During this metamorphosis, Poo is not in control of his own actions and will fight with the ability and strength of his target.<br />
<br />
Unlike the other party members, Poo cannot utilize weapons and armor in the same fashion.  There are only four pieces of equipment scattered throughout world that Poo can benefit from: the Bracer, Cloak Diadem, and sword of Kings.  Collecting all of these items is a challenge in itself but don’t worry if you’re having trouble, Poo’s remarkable psychic skill is enough to compensate for any missing pieces.  During their quest Poo will demonstrate no less than 27 psychic abilities.  Although he shares some of the same skills as Ness and Paula, he does have a number of attacks that are distinctive such as Brain Shock and a power shield that can reflect physical attacks.  PSI Starstorm is Poo’s ultimate attack however.  The Starstorm is unique in that it is not realized by leveling up like other psychic powers, instead, an elderly man known only as the Star Master will visit the party every so often to pass along this power to Prince Poo.  The final form of this attack is arguably the most powerful in the game rivaled only by Ness’s PSI Rockin’ omega.</p><br />
