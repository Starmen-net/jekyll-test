In Mother 2, there is almost no debate over how things are to be pronounced, thanks to the fact that there is generally only one pronunciation for each kana in Japanese. But our crazy pronunciation rules in English mean that words in EarthBound can have <b>many</b> possible pronunciations. Some people will fight to the death for their preferred pronunciation.

So to try to avoid any such conflict, here is a quick pronunciation guide for some of the trickier words in EarthBound.

<ul>
 <li>Onett - </li>
 <li>Giygas -</li>
 <li>Magicant - The "c" here is a hard "c", so it's like putting the words "magic" and "can't" together.</li>
 <li>Dalaam -</li>
 <li>Shigesato Itoi - "Shee-geh-sah-toh  Ee-toy"</li>
</ul>
