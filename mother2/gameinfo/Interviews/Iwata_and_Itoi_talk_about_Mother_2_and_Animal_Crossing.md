A few days before Animal Crossing: New Leaf's release, Satoru Iwata visited Itoi to discuss the game. Near the end of the interview, Mother 2 was brought up.
<br /><br />
<b>Itoi:</b> It’d be great for people who have never played the series to play this game. It’s—well, it’s a game that doesn’t have many struggles to it. It’s just filled with wonderful things
<br /><br />
<b>Iwata:</b> “Adults, children, and even your older sister.”
<br /><br />
<b>Itoi:</b> Yeah. (laughs)
<br /><br />
<b>Iwata:</b> This is kind of a personal thing, but when we made MOTHER 2 and you wrote the phrase “Adults, children, and even your older sister”… if you hadn’t been focusing on that idea, I don’t think I would have ever announced Nintendo’s intentions to expand the gaming population [when I took over as president]. So that slogan of yours turned out to be critical advice for me.
<br /><br />
<b>Itoi:</b> And that sense of “Adults, children, and even your older sister” is quite clear in Animal Crossing.
