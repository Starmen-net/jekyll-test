EarthBound was obviously a unique game from the moment people first laid eyes on it. It came packaged in a giant box in order to store an equally unique player's guide. In addition to clay models, newspaper clippings, adverts, and scratch n' sniff cards, the EarthBound player's guide also includes many errors. Most are simply the result of creating the guide before the localization changes between Mother 2 and EarthBound were done. Others are just the result of poor information or overlooked mistakes. Whatever the case, all of the guide's  errors are listed here.
