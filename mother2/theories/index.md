Okay, this all starts in the 1970s. John Andonuts, famous as the greatest non-evil scientist alive at the time, was asked by the Winters government to participate in a cloning project that would help produce smarter children. Using then-experimental methods, they managed to clone eight fetuses with Dr. Andonuts's genetic code, then combine these into three fetuses, one with all-dominant genes, one with all-recessive genes, and a third with a balance between them.
<br/><br/><br/>
Fast-forward!
<br/><br/><br/>
1990. The triplets are living seperate lives, completely unaware of each other's existance. Jeff, who received his father's recessive genes, has been accepted to the Snow Wood Boarding School for the Ridiculously Gifted. His surrogate mother, meanwhile, has moved to Summers to start a career as a pastry chef. In her time there, she has met and fallen for a handsome young sea captain, and they are engaged to be married.
<br/><br/><br/>
So this raises the question of why neither Jeff nor his mother recognized each other when they met in Summers. Well, the fact is, they had never seen each other before. Jeff was given to a foster mother right after being born. And the foster mother mysteriously disappeared shortly after Jeff was enrolled at Snow Wood.
<br/><br/><br/>
So, to answer your question, Jeff has three mothers: His foster mother, the Magic Cake woman, and SCIENCE! He also has two brothers, but I don't know who they are.<br /><br />

Man...  I wish MY mom was a pastry chef.

<br /><br />Hmm. The subject of Jeff's mom is a particularly sensitive one, because we honestly have no clue as to her identity, or if she even exists. One thing is known, though, and that is that your life will be incomplete and have no meaning if you do not take advantage of this fantastic opportunity!

Good point there, eh? No one really thinks about this, but well... I DID. Actually, when I played Earthbound for the first time, I always wondered who was the wacky wife who married such a weird scientist dude like Dr. Andonuts. And ever since I finished Earthbound, I have been thinking about it! So my theory is extra-cooked. Here it comes!
<br /><br/><br/><br/>


Okay, Andonuts was just like any of us, people. He went to discoteques (e_e), had parties and stuff like that. Well, he was always good at science and was decided to follow a career which mixed science. Though that, he maintained as a secret, he was very shy and didn't like to tell about his life at all. Anyway, in one of his parties with his friends, he met the person who would be his wife, Clara. Yeah, Clara, never mentioned, but existant. Bla bla bla they liked each other, they married, stuff.
<br/><br/><br/>


Now married, Andonuts couldn't continue hiding his secret. Andonuts showed Clara his inventions, and strangely enough, Clara was amazed. She didn't get mad for anything, but instead started testing Andonut's experiments.
<br/><br/><br/>


One fellow day, Andonuts had just finished the Out-runner, a prototype of the Sky Runner, which was bigger, but did the same function of the Sky Runner. Once again, Clara was amazed. Andonuts obviously hadn't tested it away, but Clara seemed so amazed about it, she decided to try it already. Before continuing, I would like to point something out: Ever wondered why Andonut's second floor is THAT pathetic? I mean, it's a little square corridor, totally useless. Well, that wasn't like that before, when he was with Clara. That was, indeed, Andonut/Clara's room. Oh well, I'll continue. (PS: Jeff had born a while ago, he says no more than 1 month old by now.)
<br/><br/><br/>


So well, here is the great accident Andonuts had. Since he didn't test the Out-runner, everything went wrong. He had forgotten sometrhing extremely important about it, and the Out-Runner couldn't be controled without it. Clara entered it and started looking at everything. Andonuts started the Outrunner, but it didn't went as he exp√®cted. The Out-Runner went nuts, destroyed all the Second Floor and went flying away. It didn't take long for the Out-Runner to crash a mountain, and sadly, explode. 
<br/><br/><br/>


Clara didn't survive. Indeed, she died. Jeff never "met" his mom at all, and that's why he has no memories about her.

<br/><br/><br/>

Andonut's ego went down horribly, and stopped building machines. But then he thought "Clara would be glad to see me continue with my job...". And so he took pieces of the out-Runner and, with them, build the Sky Runner.

<br/><br/><br/>

Andonuts ignores his past and looks to the present. he always hs Clara in his mind, and that's his inspiration to continue inventing. THE END. And this isn't the truth, then Andonuts married an X Lady and transformed her into Tessie or something! Anyway, bye! e_e

NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! NOT CLARA!!!!

 Jeff and Venus are brother and sister.  That is, Venus' mom is Jeff's mom.


<br /><br /><br />
Venus' musical talent is how their father's genius manifests itself in her.

<br /><br /><br />

Both Jeff and Venus have blond hair.

<br /><br /><br />

Mr. Spoon moved in the same crowd as Jeff's parents when they were younger, hanging out with Andonuts and Fork in the Stoic Club back in 196X when even scientists were all bohemian. Venus' mom was a waitress there making tons of money serving water and was quite a catch for Andonuts, though they eventually split up after a nasty kerfuffle over Andonuts' relationship with Caveman jr... Anyway, that explains the deeper creepier reason for Spoon stalking Venus. He liked Venus' mom but Andonuts was always the more suave, so now Spoon lives vicariously through his fascination with the daughter he might have had.

<br /><br />
--------------------------------
<br /><br />
Wow.  But... What if the whole hair thing is a coincidence?<br /><br />

Well Jeff's mother is really a mystery isn't it? With my messed up logic I figured out who she is.  The simple answer actually its a petri dish. Jeff is a clone of the Doc. He was bored and lonely one night one thing led to another and after a few lonely night Jeff was created in the petri dish. Of course the Doc didnt come up with the technology himself. He had help, from the healer dude, and Mr. T look a like.  The invented the machine run by the Shrooms that grow on your head. This theory has to be true cause if it wasnt how could the doc get a girl he is sooooo old and Jeff is only like 10 it logically don't make sense if he actually has a mother. I mean a respectable old doctor would not have a wife young enough to bare children.

My third cousin's aunt's sister's second cousin twice removed's great grandmother is a petri dish.<br />
