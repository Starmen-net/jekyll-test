The bubble monkey.. ah, yes. The bubble monkey did not always call himself bubble monkey, but he was once an ordinary monkey, like you or me. After moving to winters, he soon became friends with the local lake "monster" tessie. Tessie lives mostly underwater, but whenever (s)he comes up to greet his friend bubble monkey, large pockets of air, (bubbles) are formed. Now. Since the bubble monkey is advanced enough to speak, he is obviously smart enough to figure out simple functions. From then on, he began trying to blow bubbles with his spit. This, however, did not work out. So he bought a pack of BG, and lo and behold.. a glorious bubble! This was many years ago, however, and he has perfected his technique since then.<br /><br />

Hmm...  Monkey spit bubbles...  Eeewwww!  Nice job, Yoshi.  You beat every other theory by...  Let's just say you beat them.

Hmmm...  Would anyone wish to discuss?  I wouldn't.  Sorry Mister...

Three Options:
1: It may be self taught.
2: The people in the store that give the monkey buble gum showed him.
3: Another monkey may have shown him.
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Hmmm...  I like how you included three options, but it isn't really entertaining.  But still, nice job.

It's obvious. You *obviously* find the bubble monkey in that little *obvious* shop right? Well he obviously watched other kids buy gum and blow their own *obvious* bubbles, obviously.

Count the Obviouses!  One, two, three, four, five.  Five obviouses!<br /><br />
(Note:  Some Obviouses may have been added for humour.)<br /><br />
