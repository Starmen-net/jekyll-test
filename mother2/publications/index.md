We've attemped to gather as many Japanese and U.S. magazine articles about MOTHER 2 and EarthBound as possible. In here, you'll find many interesting items, including pictures of MOTHER 2 when it was still in a very early form, and many interviews with Shigesato Itoi and other people on the MOTHER 2 and EarthBound teams. Sadly, the Japanese interviews aren't translated, though maybe someday they will be.
<br /><br />
Obviously, we're missing a lot of magazine issues here, and there are many other magazines from the early 1990s that featured early MOTHER 2 stuff, but they're so hard to find nowadays that collecting them is slow-going. But if you happen to have any old magazines featuring stuff we don't have here, let us know!
<br /><br />
Due to the number of publications, we have decided to separate the scans by language, so you can pick which section you'd like to peruse below. Anyway, browse and enjoy!
