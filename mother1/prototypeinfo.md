TAYLOR HATH DISRESPECTED THIS PAGE! BOING! This page is dedicated to being the definitive source for Earthbound Beginnings Prototype Cartridges! <br /><br />

Back during Nintendo of America's failed localization of Mother in 1990, these prototypes were used for beta testing. Many were sent out to Nintendo Game Counselors to scan for bugs and typos, and to send to other divisions of Nintendo for evaluation. In addition, Cartridge #1 was the source that Neo Demiforce used to make the translation available for play on emulators (under the title "Earthbound Zero")!<br /><br />

There are at least 6 prototype cartridges to exist, with at least 5 outside of Nintendo. Many of these carts are in the hands of the collectors, and I've spent the past couple years talking to owners and collecting as much information as I can! Almost all of the information listed on this page is from my personal interviews of various EBB Prototype owners, Phil Sandhop, and Demi of Neo Demiforce. I'm still working on getting fancy, official interviews set up and documented, so maybe someday I'll have some provided!<br /><br />

I'll try my hardest to keep this up-to-date, so if you have information you want updated PM me <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/forum/newpm/sithmaster96">here!</a>

Current Owner: Andrew "zeldaboy" DeRouin <br /><br />

Line of Ownership: NoA -> Greg Mariotti -> Kenny Brooks -> Andrew DeRouin<br /><br />

History: This is the first prototype cartridge found, and the one that Earthbound Zero came from!<br />
This prototype was made in February of 1994 (a long while after the translation was complete) as an evaluation copy to send to Nintendo of Canada Limited (NOCL). The intent was to see if they'd be interested in releasing the game in Canada, which failed as well when NoA backed out. <br /><br />

Somewhere down the line it was given to the owner of a retro game store called FamCom Games in the Greater Seattle Area (sadly out of business, as of 2014) by a Nintendo employee. It was bought for about $100-$150 by Greg Mariotti, an NES collector. Mariotti would later sell this cartridge in 1998 along with his collection of around 700 NES games to buy his first house; While the rest were sold offline, he sold this game to Kenny Brooks via an online message board for $100.<br /><br />

Kenny Brooks was then contacted by Neo Demiforce, who wanted to pull the ROM off of it to make it playable on emulators. Worried that it might decrease the value of the cartridge, Kenny Brooks let them borrow it for a sum of $400. The team agreed, and pooled together the cash to make the deal. The game soon became available online as Earthbound Zero.<br /><br />

Kenny Brooks sold the cartridge to Andrew DeRouin in 2000, after DeRouin saved up for an entire year to pay for it. The sale price was $1000, and he's had it ever since.

Current Owner: Joey "Roo" DeSena<br /><br />

Line of Ownership: NoA -> ??? -> Jollerancher -> sample_seller -> dieyoung7 -> Roo<br /><br />

History: This prototype cartridge is one of the two found in Jollerancher's "infamous haul." (LINK HERE) Jollerancher found this cart (along with Prototype #3) while on vacation in the Hamptons in 2006, when he stumbled across the garage sale of a former Nintendo employee. Along with these carts, he found a number of other prototypes, shirts, and rare Nintendo collectibles.<br /><br />

Not much is known about the exact details of the time in-between Jollerancher selling the cart of Sample_seller and Roo buying it from Dieyoung7 in 2010 (for about $1100), but I'm working on setting up an interview with Jollerancher himself to learn more about the carts and find some of the missing links!<br /><br />

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CARTS: Interestingly enough, the Jollerancher carts themselves have some minor differences to the rest of the prototypes. They have dot-matrix printed labels (unlike Prototype #1, which has handwritten labels), and have AMD brand EPROM chips as opposed to the other prototypes' Hitachi-made chips. The EPROM chips are also soldered right onto the board, while the other prototypes are mounted on DIP sockets for easy removal and reprogramming.

Line of Ownership: NoA -> ??? -> Jollerancher -> dr_curtis -> Andrew Bixler<br /><br />

This prototype cartridge is the second of two found in Jollerancher's "infamous haul." (LINK HERE)<br /><br />

This cart was bought from Jollerancher by Dr_curtis' wife as a gift for $2,100 in early 2006. Dr_curtis kept it until March 30th, 2008 when he sold it to Andrew Bixler for $1469. He has kept it ever since.

Line of Ownership: NoA -> Matt Alderman -> ??? <br /><br />

History: Not a ton is known about where this cart is or how much it sold for. The first seller was a former Nintendo Game Counselor named Matt Alderman. According to him (as well as Phil Sandhop in the interview I did with him in 2014), Phil would farm out beta testing to Game Play Counselors during the localization process. At the end of the project in 1990, Alderman kept the prototype and eventually tried to auction it off on eBay in 2009. The auction was flagged by trolls and taken down, which led to him selling it privately to an unknown buyer. Alderman supposedly told administrators on-site here about who he sold it to and how much it was sold for, but the buyer requested it be kept quiet (at least until things calmed down). <br /><br />

I've been working hard on this one, so hopefully sometime soon I'll find a good lead. I'll update this when I find out more.

Line of Ownership: NoA -> ??? -> Unknown Owner <br /><br />

History: This one I know honestly nothing about, other than that it showed up at the Merchandise Museum at Camp Fangamer 2015. It DID come from Nintendo of America, as confirmed by Fangamer. Everything else is unknown.

From my estimate, there are at least 2 or 3 more cartridges that exist, with at least one confirmed for Nintendo of America. Phil Sandhop said he left two bolted, final version cartridges in his desk when he left Nintendo of America in May of 2004, which leads me to believe that those might still be there. There's also the chance that the one they used to bring Earthbound Beginnings to Virtual Console was a different one from those two, which would bring the tentative count at NoA to 3.<br /><br />

Who knows if more are lurking in the shadows? Or even in the hands of private owners! The world is full of surprises.
