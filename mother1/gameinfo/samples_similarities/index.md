<br />One of the few similarities in EBB comes from "Johnny B. Goode" by Chuck Berry. Both the main and rhythmic melodies are mimicked in the Hippe Battle theme as well as its other variations in the other Mother games.

<br />Unlike most of the samples and similarities, in this case, Pokemon is the one who used Mother music as an inspiration! The song played on Victory Road is remarkably similar to that of EBB's Mt. Itoi. It's also worth mentioning both are played toward the end of their respective games.
