<em>Catherine Warwick</em><br />
When you are happy<br />
With laughter to spare<br />
Fun is twice as fun<br />
With someone to share<br />
When you are lonely<br />
And full of despair<br />
Things aren't half as had<br />
When somebody cares<br /><br />

<em>Jeremy Holland-Smith (with Catherine Warwick)</em><br />
Maybe now you have figured it out<br />
That's what bein' a friend is about<br />
When you're lookin'<br />
For a shoulder you can cry on (Won't you think about me?)<br />
When you're lookin'<br />
For someone you can rely on (Don't you ever doubt me)<br /> <br />

<em>Together</em><br />
I'll be there someway, somehow<br />
That's what bein' friends is about<br /><br />

<em>Warwick</em><br />
When you are restless<br />
And want room to breathe<br />
I will give you all<br />
The space that you need<br />
And when you're ready<br />
For my company<br />
I will come around<br />
Just call on me<br />
<br />
<em>Holland-Smith (with Warwick)</em><br />
Maybe now you have figured it out<br />
That's what bein' a friend is about<br />
When you need someone <br />
Who feels the way you do (Won't you think about me?)<br />
Someone who can pick you up<br />
When you are blue (Don't you ever doubt me)<br /><br />

<em>Together</em><br />
I'll be there someway, somehow<br />
That's what bein' friends is about<br /><br />

I'm your friend till the end<br />
Count on me<br />
In the sunshine and the rain<br />
Paradise and back again<br />
Count on me<br />
Let me be a friend in need<br />
Let me be a friend indeed<br />
Count on me<br /><br />

<em>Warwick</em><br />
And if you ask me<br />
You know that it's true<br />
There is not a thing<br />
That I wouldn't do<br />
I'd follow you<br />
To the ends of the earth<br />
That's how much I think<br />
Our friendship is worth<br /><br />

<em>Holland-Smith (with Warwick)</em><br />
Maybe now you have figured it out<br />
That's what bein' a friend is about<br />
When there's something<br />
That you just don't understand (Won't you think about me?)<br />
I'll be more than glad<br />
To lend a helping hand (Don't you ever doubt me?)<br />
I'll be there someway, somehow<br />
That's what bein' friends is about<br />
I'll be there someway, somehow<br />
That's what bein' friends is about<br /><br />

Tell me all your secrets<br />
I will swear to keep them<br />
Let me know your problems<br />
I will help you solve them<br />
When your heart is aching<br />
I will stop it breaking<br />
Whet you are in danger<br />
I'm your guardian angel<br />
I will stand beside you<br />
Be the one to guide you<br />
When your dreams are crumblin'<br />
Call me I'll come runnin'<br />
That's what friends are all about<br />
