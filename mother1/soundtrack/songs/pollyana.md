<p>
I believe the morning sun <br />
Always gonna shine again and<br />
I believe a pot of gold<br />
Waits at every rainbow's end<br />
I believe in roses kissed with dew<br />
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you?<br /><br />

I believe in make-believe<br />
Fairy tales and lucky charms and<br />
I believe in promises<br />
Spoken as you cross your heart<br />
I believe in skies forever blue<br />
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you?<br />
<br />
You may say I'm a fool<br />
Feelin' the way that I do<br />
You can call me Pollyanna<br />
Say I'm crazy as a loon<br />
I believe in silver linings<br />
And that's why I believe in you<br />
<br />
I believe there'll come a day<br />
Maybe it will be tomorrow<br />
When the bluebird flies away<br />
All we have to do is follow<br />
I believe a dream can still come true<br />
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you?<br /><br />

You may say I'm a fool<br />
Feelin' the way that I do<br />
I believe in friends and laughter<br />
And the wonders love can do<br />
I believe in songs and magic<br />
And that's why I believe in you<br />
<br />
You may say I'm a fool<br />
Feelin' this way about you<br />
There's not much I can do<br />
I'm gonna be this way my life through<br />
'Cause I still believe in miracles<br />
I swear I've seen a few<br />
And the time will surely come<br />
When you can see my point of view<br />
I believe in second chances<br />
And that's why I believe in you<br />
</p>
