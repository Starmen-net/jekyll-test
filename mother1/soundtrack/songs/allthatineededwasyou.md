I used to think I was so smart<br />
But I couldn't hide the hole in my heart<br />
Sad as it seems none of my dreams<br />
Ever came true<br /><br />

I used to walk the avenue<br />
All by myself with nothin' to do<br />
Kickin' at cans, half of a man<br />
Till I met you, and I knew<br /><br />

*I've looked for you all of my life<br />
Round every corner<br />
Wishin' on stars<br />
Like some kind of fool, ooh ooh<br />
But now I see the stars in your eyes<br />
Those days are over<br />
I took one look and I was hooked<br />
I found heaven in you<br /><br />

**And though my dream was overdue<br />
My prayer was answered out of the blue<br />
And now I know. I know it's true<br />
All that I needed was you<br /><br />

(Chorus)<br />
You were all that I wanted<br />
You were all that I needed<br /><br />

I was lost, anyone could tell<br />
Just tossing dimes in wishing wells<br />
Out of money and down on luck<br />
Was I surprised when lightnin' struck<br />
And suddenly, you were sent to me<br />
My destiny. it was meant to be<br />
I didn't know before<br />
What I was living for<br />
But now I know for sure<br />
I have been waiting for you<br /><br />

I never knew what I had missed<br />
Until the moment that we kissed<br />
Angel divine, now you are mine<br />
I feel brand new<br /><br />

And now at last my life's complete<br />
Baby, your love's the missing piece<br />
Here in my arms, here in my heart<br />
All that I needed was you<br /><br />
(*Repeat)<br />   (**Repeat)<br /><br />(Chorus)
