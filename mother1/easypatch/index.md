<p>For a lot of people, EarthBound Zero isn't very fun because of the excessive level-grinding necessary, particularly during the early parts of the game. To help alleviate this problem, we've made a very small IPS patch that doubles the experience and the money you receive from enemies. According to some, this actually makes the game a little <b>too</b> easy, but for the first-time player, it's probably pretty decent.</p>

You can download the patch <a href="http://starmen.net/mother1/easypatch/eb0_easypatch.ips">here</a>.

To use the patch:
<ol>
<li>You'll also need an EarthBound Zero ROM. This you'll have to get yourself.</li>
<li>You'll need an emulator for NES games of course.</li>
<li>Many emulators have an "auto-patching" feature. Read the emulator documentation for details.</li>
<li>If you need to hard-patch the ROM, look for utilities like Lunar IPS or jIPS.</li>
</ol>

You can use any version of the EB0 ROM, but it's always best to use a clean, unmodified ROM when applying a patch. If you've patched the ROM successfully, you'll see the word "EASY" next to the game's title on the title screen.
