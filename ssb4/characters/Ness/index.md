<img class="picright" src="Ness.png" /> Ness: Hailing from the small town of Onett in Eagleland is Ness, the PK Powerhouse! He brings with him his trusty baseball bat, signature hat, and a yo-yo for killing time and other fighters. While not the most powerful of the Chosen Four, he is well rounded as he can <i>Smaaaaaaaaaaaash!!!</i> with weapons, use the powerful PK Rockin to blast all his foes, and support his friends with various shields and recovery PSI abilities. Back home in his game of Earthbound, he goes on a quest to find the three other members of the Chosen Four, visit all eight My Sanctuaries, and stop an unfathomable evil. Along with beating up dogs, barf, hippies, and sentient coffee. Just remember to smile and say “Fuzzy Pickles!”
