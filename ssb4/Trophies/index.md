  <tr>
    <th><a href="Able Sisters.png" ><img src="Able Sisters_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Able Sisters</b></th>
    <th>Able Sisters is a clothing and tailoring shop run by three completely different sisters. The oldest, Sable, quietly sews in the corner. The middle child, Labelle, sells accessories, and the youngest, Mabel, greets customers cheerfully. They fought in the past but have put that behind them!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Beehive.png" ><img src="Beehive_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Beehive</b></th>
    <th>An example of fine architecture constructed by insects, these bees are not shy about defending their hard work. Throw this at an enemy to direct their hate at that player. If the bees are after you, you can shake them for a while with some evasive maneuvers, but they'll track you down.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Blathers.png" ><img src="Blathers_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Blathers</b></th>
    <th>Blathers knows all there is to know about fossils, which is probably why he is in charge of the town museum. He also knows about fish and art, but he seems a bit squeamish when it comes to bugs. It has something to do with childhood trauma. Regardless, if you pop by during the day, you'll catch him napping.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Brewster.png" ><img src="Brewster_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Brewster</b></th>
    <th>If you stop in the Roost, you'll spot Brewster behind the counter, ready to serve you a cup of his original blend. You know you're a regular when Brewster becomes slightly more talkative. Never too aloof, never too familiar, he's as comfy to have around as a pigeon-milk latte.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Bus to the City.png" ><img src="Bus to the City_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Bus to the City</b></th>
    <th>The bus that takes you into the city in Animal Crossing: City Folk. It's free 24/7 and driven by a certain someone you might recognize (you might have also seen him driving a boat or a taxi). Take the bus anytime to see places like the theatre and the art gallery, and try visiting at night to see some places that are usually closed.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Celeste.png" ><img src="Celeste_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Celeste</b></th>
    <th>Celeste works in the town museum, where you can find her dozing during the day. You can't really be mad about that, though- she is an owl, after all. Most residents will let her sleep, knowing that she'll wake up promptly if she's needed. What could she be dreaming about?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Don.png" ><img src="Don_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Don</b></th>
    <th>Don and Sonny Resetti run the Reset Surveillance Center. They keep a careful eye out for players who might be resetting their games without saving. As Don likes to say, "Resettin' ain't good. So don't do it!" If Sonny is the brother who catches you, you'll hear a lot more than that!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Dream Home.png" ><img src="Dream House_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Dream Home</b></th>
    <th>If you're wanting to buy a house in Animal Crossing, Tom Nook is always happy to help. And it looks like he's expanding his business to Smash Bros, too. If you activate the Villager's Final Smash, Nook will rush in and build a house for you right then and there! One small, very minor difference between this house and ones in the original game? This one explodes.</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Dr. Shrunk.png" ><img src="Dr. Shrunk_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Dr. Shrunk</b></th>
    <th>Dr. Shrunk definitely has a...unique look about him. As the owner of Club LOL, a new entertainment venue, he isn't shy about taking the stage. It's too bad his jokes don't always fly. If you want a taste of his humor, take him some treats before the show starts!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Frillard.png" ><img src="Frillard_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Frillard</b></th>
    <th>Ready for a real thrill? Frillard is getting up there in years and doesn't appear on stage all that often, but if you're lucky enough to catch one of his shows, you're in for a real treat! Frillard will spread that frill and show you emotion in motion. Dr. Shrunk is a student of his, but that frill gag is one only the master can do.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Gracie.png" ><img src="Gracie_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Gracie</b></th>
    <th>Gracie is a celebrity fashion designer who is really pretty critical of others. She'll happily let you know if your current look is hip or hippy, if you ask her. Aside from style reviews, she also runs her own little boutique, which she feels is a sanctuary from all the awful style choices.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Harriet.png" ><img src="Harriet_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Harriet</b></th>
    <th>Sometimes the only thing you need to turn your day around is a nice haircut. If you visit Shampoodle, Harriet will quiz you a bit and, before you can say "sugar," you'll have a brand-new, perfect hairstyle. In Animal Crossing: City Folk, she offers a makeover that leaves you looking like a Mii!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Isabelle.png" ><img src="Isabelle_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Isabelle</b></th>
    <th>Isabelle is the mayor's highly capable secretary. She can be forgetful sometimes, but you can always count on her for information about the town. She wears her hair up in a bun that makes her look like a shih tzu. Mostly because she is one! She also has a twin brother named Digby.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Jingle.png" ><img src="Jingle_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Jingle</b></th>
    <th>Happy Toy Day! (If it's not Toy Day, then... happy other-time-of-the-year!) Jingle's a festive reindeer who stops by once a year. If you happen to be dressed as Santa and have a bit of free time on your hands, why not help him out? Just imagine the looks on your neighbors' faces when they get a present personally delivered by Santa!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Joan.png" ><img src="Joan_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Joan</b></th>
    <th>Joan has been in the business of selling turnips for about 60 years now, and she'll happily explain the basics when you talk to her. Taking the risk is entirely up to you, though. If you take the plunge, you'll want to check the prices often. It doesn't hurt to ask your friends about their prices too.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Katie.png" ><img src="Katie_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Katie</b></th>
    <th>After playing with a friend, you may spot a crying, lost little kitten in your town. Thankfully, she knows where her mommy should be waiting. If you offer to take her there, she'll do her best to follow behind. You'll help out this poor kitten, won't you?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Katrina.png" ><img src="Katrina_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Katrina</b></th>
    <th>Keeeeeeeeeee hamo-ata... Keeee haaaaaamo-atata... Every so often, Katrina will set up her tent to reveal your future and the path to avoid disaster (for a small fee, of course). She bases her predictions on your birthday, so we hope you entered it correctly!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Kicks.png" ><img src="Kicks_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Kicks</b></th>
    <th>Crikey! This shoeshine has really come up in the world. He used to work in a faraway city, but now he runs a shoe store with an impressive collection of shoes to choose from. And you can tell from that sharp-looking hat he's wearing that his is a style you can trust.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="K.K. Slider.png" ><img src="K.K. Slider_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>K.K. Slider</b></th>
    <th>His fans can't wait for Saturday evenings. Why? Because K.K. Slider performs live! The crowd goes wild when K.K. Slider plays some of his greatest hits, like K.K. Samba, K.K. Waltz, and K.K. Stroll, on his acoustic guitar. He sometimes even takes request! Other days, you can find him spinning tunes at Club LOL as a DJ.'</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Lloid.png" ><img src="Lloid_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Lloid</b></th>
    <th>Gyroids are a common sight in the Animal Crossing series. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, a Gyroid named Lloid dons a helmet and collects funds for public works. The Villager makes use of a rocket-powered Lloid for his side special. The farther he flies, the more powerful his attack will be!</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Lyle.png" ><img src="Lyle_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Lyle</b></th>
    <th>Lyle has filled a lot of roles over the years, but in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, he's taken on management of the Happy Home Academy. Drop by to chat, or ask and he'll tell you how the HHA ranks your home. This is a new kind of job for Lyle... You could say he's turned a new leaf!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Pascal.png" ><img src="Pascal_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Pascal</b></th>
    <th>"People say there are always other fish in the sea, but, maaan, there are giant squids in there too." That's Pascal, ever the marine philosopher. He appears when a scallop is found, dispensing his philosophical thoughts and trading furniture for the scallop.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Phineas.png" ><img src="Phineas_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Phineas</b></th>
    <th>Phineas can sometimes be found by the fountain in the big city, usually on sunny days. He's a prize man who has fun things for everyone: round balloons, bunny balloons, spinning pinwheels, and bubble wands. So many great things! What does he ask for in return? Just a smile is all.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Phyllis & Pelly.png" ><img src="Phyllis & Pelly_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Phyllis & Pelly</b></th>
    <th>The pelican sisters work at the Post Office. Phyllis has a pink color to her, and she handles the night shifts. Pelly is white and works during the day. Pelly has a crush on Pete the delivery boy, but Pete has feelings for Phyllis. Awkward! They won't let it distract them from their jobs, though.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Pitfall.png" ><img src="Pitfall_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Pitfall</b></th>
    <th>You can plant this in the ground as a trap against your enemies. If they set it off, they'll be rooted in place and at your mercy. If opponents are spending too much time in the air, throwing this at them can send them meteoring down to the ground—or better yet, right off the stage!</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Redd.png" ><img src="Redd_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Redd</b></th>
    <th>Redd runs an art gallery...of sorts. He'll try to smooth-talk you into buying his items, but be careful! Occasionally some counterfeit items slip in among the real ones. And by "sometimes" I mean "always." Brushing up on your art history may help you spot the real deal!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Resetti.png" ><img src="Resetti_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Resetti</b></th>
    <th>Be sure to save your game before you turn it off, or this guy will show up screaming "AAAAAAAARGH!" Sonny Resetti and his favorite brother, Don, keep an eye out for sudden game resets, and they aren't shy about reminding you to save often. Best not to aggravate them needlessly...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Rover.png" ><img src="Rover_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Rover</b></th>
    <th>This kitty is very outgoing, always looking to meet and learn about new people. He'll ask you all sorts of questions the first time you meet. Hopefully you don't respond with random nonsense, since you'll be stuck with your answers. Who wants to live in a town called "AAAAAAA," anyway?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Saharah.png" ><img src="Saharah_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Saharah</b></th>
    <th>Traveling from a faraway land comes the wandering salescamel, Saharah. She's got wallpaper to paper your walls with and carpets to pet your cars with. That's kind of odd, actually... Maybe it's a tradition where she comes from? Either way, she brings many unique things with her when she visits.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Serena.png" ><img src="Serena_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Serena</b></th>
    <th>If you throw an axe into the fountain, POOF, Serena appears. Ever hear that "Honesty is the best policy"? Well, with Serena, that's not always the case. In fact, if she's giving you a life lesson at all, it's that dealing with unpredictable people can be... unpredictable! Who knew throwing an axe into a fountain would turn out to be so educational?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Timmy & Tommy.png" ><img src="Timmy & Tommy_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Timmy & Tommy</b></th>
    <th>These twin brothers operate the Nookling stores. Thanks to Tom Nook's teachings, they are just as talented as he is and run Nookling Junction with such success that it can expand several times. Despite their success, they never forget the core value of good customer service.</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Tom Nook.png" ><img src="Tom Nook_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Tom Nook</b></th>
    <th>The owner of Nookington's, yes, yes. "Yes, yes" is his favorite catchphrase. Despite all the money he's earned, he'll never lose that down-to-earth charm. With such a friendly demeanor, there's just no way he could be trying to rip you off. So trustworthy, yes, yes!</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Town and City.png" ><img src="Town and City_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Town and City</b></th>
    <th>Get a bird's-eye view of the town and city from Animal Crossing: City Folk as you fight on a platform overhead. Your Wii U console's clock dictates the time of day and which animals and places appear. Don't get too distracted by all that, though, because the platform itself is pretty simple-perfect for a battle of skill!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Villager.png" ><img src="Villager_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th>Villager</th>
    <th>This energetic young man from a peaceful town in the Animal Crossing series is eager to make his Smash Bros. debut! His Balloon Trip recovery lets him fly like a character from Balloon Fight. The Villager sets out to answer that age-old question: If a tree falls on the battlefield and foes are beneath it, do they get launched?</th></tr>

  <tr>
    <th><a href="Villager Alt..png" ><img src="Villager Alt._T.png" /></a></th>
    <th>Villager (Alt.)</th>
    <th>Just a normal girl living a normal life in a normal town—her special moves, however, are anything but. She can pocket items, projectiles, and even beams, and then pull them out at a moment's notice. Her down special lets her plant a tree, water it, and chop it down. If she leaves the tree standing, she can use the axe against foes.</th></tr>

  <tr>
    <th><a href="Wendell.png" ><img src="Wendall_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Wendell</b></th>
    <th>Wendell is a wandering artist with a healthy appetite. He may be a walrus, but his tastes extend well beyond fish! In Animal Crosing: New Leaf, he only appears in dreams when the player uses the Dream Suite. He doesn't seem to be too hungry, but it is a dream- he's probably happily eating in the waking world!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Wisp.png" ><img src="Wisp_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Wisp</b></th>
    <th>Cute li'l Wisp is first met when he shyly asks for your help in collecting five spirits before the sun rises. Who would have thought the simple bug net would be able to catch them? Cool! When you next meet him, in Animal Crossing: City Folk, he becomes a lamp spirit that's scared of ghosts. Don't judge him! Ghosts are scary!</th>

    <th>Bayonetta is one of the last of the near-extinct Umbra Witches clan. She's a master of the Bullet Arts and can use her hair as a conduit to bring forth Infernal Demons. She brings all these skills and more to Smash, where she'll unleash additional damage if you hold the attack button. Damage and distract your foes with this move!</th>

    <th><b>Bayonetta (Alt.)</b></th>
    <th>If you use Bayonetta's side special in midair, she'll do a diagonal kick upward that goes through platforms. If you press down just before doing the move, it'll turn into a downward attack! Plus, if you hit an enemy in midair, you can use the attack again before you hit the ground–great for combos and recoveries!</th>

    <th><b>Bayonetta (Original)</b></th>
    <th>This Umbra Witch awakens after hundreds of years without any memories of her past life. Usually Bayonetta spends her days pretending to be a nun to lure out angels, until a witch with the same powers as her starts to slowly bring her memories back. She ends up embroiled in a battle to save the world.</th>

    <th><b>Infernal Climax</b></th>
    <th>Before her Final Smash, Bayonetta encounters Witch Time, during which she can attack the enemy to fill her magic gauge. If it fills up, she summons the demon Gomorrah, who chomps down on the unfortunate foe! Keep pressing the button during Gomorrah's attack to increase damage. If it hits 100% the enemy will be instantly KO'd!</th>

    <th><a href="Jeanne.png" ><img src="Jeanne_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Jeanne</b></th>
    <th>An Umbra Witch and old friend of Bayonetta, Jeanne wears a red bodysuit and uses the Bullet Arts fighting style to wield her four pistols, All 4 One. Jeanne saved Bayonetta from the demon Gomorrah but was mortally wounded and had her soul dragged down to Inferno. Bayonetta succeeded in rescuing her friend and returned her soul to its body.</th>

He's known for being a talented gunsmith and counts Bayonetta as a loyal customer, but it's said that if any human uses his wares, they'll suffer a terrible fate...</th>
