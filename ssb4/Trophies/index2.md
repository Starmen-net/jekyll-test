  <tr>
    <th><a href="Able Sisters.png" ><img src="Able Sisters_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Able Sisters</b></th>
    <td><center>The three Able sisters are like chalk and cheese...and thread, but running a clothes shop makes good use of their strengths: Sable works quietly at the sewing machine, Labelle sells accessories, and the cheerful Mabel welcomes people in. Despite their quirks, they get along well...usually.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Beehive.png" ><img src="Beehive_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Beehive</b></th>
    <td><center>Bees don't like it when people destroy their home, so if you break a beehive, they'll come out looking for revenge. Even if you innocently had the beehive thrown at you, you'll be the target. You can dodge all you want, but they'll probably get you in the end, and their stings'll do a LOT of damage.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Blathers.png" ><img src="Blathers_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Blathers</b></th>
    <td><center>Blathers is the perfect owl to be in charge of the town museum. He knows all there is to know about fossils, fish, and art, but he's a little squeamish when it comes to bugs. Probably had a bad experience back when he was an owlet... Anyway, pop over to the museum during the day to catch him "resting his eyes".</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Brewster.png" ><img src="Brewster_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Brewster</b></th>
    <td><center>Stop in at the Roost to see Brewster behind the counter, ready to serve you a cup of his original blend. You know you've become a regular when he starts being a bit more chatty. He's never too aloof, never too "in your face" - he's just nice to be around whenever you feel like having a pigeon-milk latte.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Bus to the City.png" ><img src="Bus to the City_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Bus to the City</b></th>
    <td><center>The bus that takes you into the city in Animal Crossing: City Folk. It's free 24/7 and driven by a certain someone you might recognize (you might have also seen him driving a boat or a taxi). Take the bus anytime to see places like the theatre and the art gallery, and try visiting at night to see some places that are usually closed.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Celeste.png" ><img src="Celeste_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Celeste</b></th>
    <td><center>Go to the town museum during the day to see Celeste working there. Working...and snoozing. You can't really blame her, though - she is an owl! If you ever need her help with something, just talk to her and she'll wake right up. If you don't need her help, though, maybe you should be nice and let her keep dreaming!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Don.png" ><img src="Don_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Don Resetti</b></th>
    <td><center>This chap runs the Reset Surveillance Center with his brother, the fabled scolder Mr. Resetti (first name: Sonny). Their job is to warn players who switch off without saving. Don's gentle about it, though. He'll say stuff like, "Resettin' ain't no good. So, um, don't do it!" If you get caught resetting, just hope it's Don's face you see.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Dream Home.png" ><img src="Dream House_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Dream Home</b></th>
    <td><center>If you're wanting to buy a house in Animal Crossing, Tom Nook is always happy to help. And it looks like he's expanding his business to Smash Bros, too. If you activate the Villager's Final Smash, Nook will rush in and build a house for you right then and there! One small, very minor difference between this house and ones in the original game? This one explodes.</center></td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Dr. Shrunk.png" ><img src="Dr. Shrunk_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Dr. Shrunk</b></th>
    <td><center>Dr. Shrunk used to be a comedian, and he looks the part. He doesn't do just any old jokes, though - he does Reaction Jokes, which are, erm...even funnier! Visit Club LOL before it opens and give him a yummy present to get a does of comedy, Shrunk style.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Frillard.png" ><img src="Frillard_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Frillard</b></th>
    <td><center>Ready for a thrill? Frillard's getting on a bit, so he doesn't appear in the theatre very often. If you're lucky enough to catch one of his shows, watch him spread that frill of his and prepare to see emotion in motion! Hard as his student Dr. Shrunk may try, that gag where he spreads his frill is one that only the master can pull off.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Gracie.png" ><img src="Gracie_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Gracie</b></th>
    <td><center>Gracie is a celebrity fashion designer and can be pretty blunt about what she thinks of other people's clothes. Want to know whether your outfit is hip or hippy? Then go and see her for one of her famous "fashion checks"! Gracie also runs her own little boutique, which she sees as a sanctuary from all the awful style choices.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Harriet.png" ><img src="Harriet_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Harriet</b></th>
    <td><center>If you want a haircut that'll make you feel brand new, pay a visit to Harriet's salon. Shampoodle. She'll ask you a few quick questions, and before you can say "sugar", you'll have the hairdo of your dreams. And since Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City, she's also been able to give special makeovers that leave you looking like a Mii!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Isabelle.png" ><img src="Isabelle_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Isabelle</b></th>
    <td><center>Isabelle's the mayor's secretary, and you couldn't ask for someone more on the ball! Well...maybe you could, but she's still full of useful info about life in the town. With her fringe and tied-up hair, she looks just like a shih-tzu! That's because she is one. And so is her twin brother, Digby.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Jingle.png" ><img src="Jingle_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Jingle</b></th>
    <td><center>Happy Toy Day! (If it's not Toy Day, then... happy other-time-of-the-year!) Jingle's a festive reindeer who stops by once a year. If you happen to be dressed as Santa and have a bit of free time on your hands, why not help him out? Just imagine the looks on your neighbors' faces when they get a present personally delivered by Santa!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Joan.png" ><img src="Joan_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Joan</b></th>
    <td><center>Joan has been in the business of selling turnips for about 60 years now, and she'll happily explain the basics when you talk to her. It's entirely up to you if you want to take the risk, though. If you do decide to, you'll want to check prices often. And it doesn't hurt to ask your friends about their prices too.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Katie.png" ><img src="Katie_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Katie</b></th>
    <td><center>After playing with a friend, you might spot a lost little kitten crying in your town. Thankfully, she knows where her mum should be waiting. If you offer to take her there, she'll toddle along behind as you lead the way. You'll help out this poor kitten, won't you? It's what any decent person would do! (Also, there's a reward.)</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Katrina.png" ><img src="Katrina_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Katrina</b></th>
    <td><center>A panther in mystical clothes who tells fortunes. Once in a while she'll set up her tent in town. Visit her for a teaser of what's in store for you - including what item will bring you luck that day. She bases her predictions on your birthday, so make sure you enter it correctly! If you put it in wrong, that would be...un-fortune-ate!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Kicks.png" ><img src="Kicks_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Kicks</b></th>
    <td><center>Hello, chum! This friendly shoe shop owner used to shine shoes in the city, but now he's managed to save up enough money for his own little shop in town. His outfit might make him look like he sweeps chimneys for a living, but don't worry - you definitely won't find any soot on his wares, awright?</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="K.K. Slider.png" ><img src="K.K. Slider_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>K.K. Slider</b></th>
    <td><center>Fans of this groovy dog just can't wait for his live show every Saturday night. With his trusty acoustic guitar, he'll treat you to such delights as the K.K. Samba, the K.K. Waltz and the K.K. Stroll. He even takes requests! In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, you can also find him on other days of the week working as a DJ at Club LOL.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Lloid.png" ><img src="Lloid_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Lloid</b></th>
    <td><center>Gyroids are a common sight in the Animal Crossing series. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, a Gyroid named Lloid dons a helmet and collects funds for public works. The Villager makes use of a rocket-powered Lloid for his side special. The further he flies, the more damage he'll do when he crashes into someone!</center></td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Lyle.png" ><img src="Lyle_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Lyle</b></th>
    <td><center>Lyle has played a few roles over the years, and in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, he's in charge of the Happy Home Academy. Feel free to drop by for a chat or to ask him how the HHA ranks your home. Lyle wasn't a big fan of this kind of work in the past, but he really seems to enjoy it this time. You could say he's turned over a new leaf!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Resetti.png" ><img src="Resetti_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Mr. Resetti</b></th>
    <td><center>Forget to save your game before stopping for the day? "GRRAAAAH!" You're going to hear from Mr. Resetti! He and his brother, Don, keep an eye out for reckless resetting and give you a, er...gentle reminder not to. Tempted to "forget" so you can meet them again? Don't. Just don't.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Pascal.png" ><img src="Pascal_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Pascal</b></th>
    <td><center>The philosophical wisdom of Pascal comes in all shapes and sizes. Some of his musings will leave you mildly puzzled: "You ever tried to play an oboe underwater, maaan? It ain't easy." Others will leave you flat-out baffled: "You can't fool physics, maaan. That guy knows EVERYTHING!" Give him a scallop and see what he says!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Phineas.png" ><img src="Phineas_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Phineas</b></th>
    <td><center>On sunny days near the fountain in the big city, you'll sometimes find a friendly fur seal called Phineas. He's also known as the prize man, and he's got fun things for everyone! He's got round balloons, bunny balloons, spinning pinwheels and bubble wands. How much, you ask? Why, all he wants in return is your smile.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Phyllis & Pelly.png" ><img src="Phyllis & Pelly_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Phyllis & Pelly</b></th>
    <td><center>The pelican sisters both work at the Post Office. Phyllis (the one with all the make-up on) handles the night shifts, and Pelly takes care of things during the day. Pelly fancies the delivery boy, Pete, but he actually has feelings for Phyllis. Awkwaaarrrd! At least they never let the drama distract them from doing their jobs!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Pitfall.png" ><img src="Pitfall_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Pitfall</b></th>
    <td><center>Bury this item anywhere you like, then wait for an unsuspecting fighter to step on it. They'll drop into a hole and be stuck there, giving you the chance to practise your best smashes on them. If that's not for you, try hitting your opponent with it in mid-air for a devastating meteor smash!</center></td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Redd.png" ><img src="Redd_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Redd</b></th>
    <td><center>The owner of a gallery selling fine art. He tends to butter up his customers, telling them whatever they look at is an amazing find. But beware! Sometimes fakes get mixed in with the genuine masterpieces. Whether he's aware of it or not, Redd is running one shady operation.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Rover.png" ><img src="Rover_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Rover</b></th>
    <td><center>Always thrilled to meet new people on the move, he'll ask you your name and where you're moving to. Don't just answer with random nonsense, though. After all, you'll be stuck with the answers you give, and who wants to live in a town called "AAAAAAAA"?!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Saharah.png" ><img src="Saharah_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Saharah</b></th>
    <td><center>A trader from a faraway land who's big on interior design. She doesn't have her own store, instead carrying her wares around as a travelling merchant - it's hard to tell where you'll find her next! She claims to have many wallpapers for the papering of walls, and carpets for the...petting of cars? Nobody's quite sure if she's being serious.</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Serena.png" ><img src="Serena_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Serena</b></th>
    <td><center>If you throw an axe into the fountain, POOF, Serena appears. Ever hear that "Honesty is the best policy"? Well, with Serena, that's not always the case. In fact, if she's giving you a life lesson at all, it's that dealing with unpredictable people can be... unpredictable! Who knew throwing an axe into a fountain would turn out to be so educational?</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Timmy & Tommy.png" ><img src="Timmy & Tommy_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Timmy & Tommy</b></th>
    <td><center>These twin brothers start off with the little shop Nookling Junction, but they seem to have learned a little something from Tom Nook, and it doesn't take long before the T&T Emporium is open for business! (So fancy.) But no matter how big and impressive their shops get, they've still got a lot to learn...</center></td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Tom Nook.png" ><img src="Tom Nook_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Tom Nook</b></th>
    <td><center>The owner of Nookington's, yes, yes. ..."Yes, yes" is sort of a reassuring catchphrase of his that totally removes any lingering feeling that he might be trying to swindle you out of your hard-earned cash. What an upstanding businessman, yes, yes!</center></td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Town and City.png" ><img src="Town and City_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Town and City</b></th>
    <td><center>Get a bird's-eye view of the town and city from Animal Crossing: City Folk as you fight on a platform overhead. Your Wii U console's clock dictates the time of day and which animals and places appear. Don't get too distracted by all that, though, because the platform itself is pretty simple-perfect for a battle of skill!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Villager.png" ><img src="Villager_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th>Villager</th>
    <td><center>This chipper chap came all the way from his quiet little village to do a bit of aerial sightseeing, take Lloid out for a spin, look after the trees and maybe do some bowling. If you're very lucky, he might even bring along Tom Nook and the Nooklings and throw everyone a party. Gosh, this all sounds like such fun!</center></td></tr>

  <tr>
    <th><a href="Villager Alt..png" ><img src="Villager Alt._T.png" /></a></th>
    <th>Villager (Alt.)</th>
    <td><center>This girl's special moves are very special indeed. The standard one lets you pocket items, projectiles and even laser beams, then use them by pressing the button again. Her down special plants a tree, which you can water and finally chop down to hurt other fighters. Or you can leave the tree alone and attack with the axe. Up to you.</center></td></tr>

  <tr>
    <th><a href="Wendell.png" ><img src="Wendall_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Wendell</b></th>
    <td><center>A travelling artist with a big appetite. Since he's a walrus, you might think he'd only eat fish, but he'll also gobble up fruit, nuts and...pretty much anything. You could say he's a fan of the "sea food diet". In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, he only appears in dreams, when you visit the Dream Suite. At least then he's not too hungry!</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><a href="Wisp.png" ><img src="Wisp_T.png" /></a></th>
    <th><b>Wisp</b></th>
    <td><center>When cute lil Wisp shows up in the first Animal Crossing, he shyly asks players to help him collect five spirits before dawn. Surprisingly, you can just use any old bug net for the job! In Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City, he appears as a lamp spirit with a fear of ghosts. Odd thing for a spirit to be scared of, don't you think?</center></td>

    <th>These Pikmin are made of solid rock, so they can stand up to a lot of attacks and won't get hurt when they get stepped on. They specialize in body blows, dealing a lot of damage when thrown, and they can also break right through glass and crystal. They can't latch on to other creatures, though.

Despite typically being found near water, it's not much of a swimmer.</th>

In this game, it'll use Cotton Spore to slow down all of the other fighters. See? Definitely not edible. Fun fact: if you trade Swirlix while it's holding a Whipped Dream, it'll evolve!</th>

    <th><b>Sylveon</b></th>
    <th>Sylveon is one of Eevee's various final evolutions. It has a lot of great attacks to use in battle, but it actually seems to be a peace-loving sort of Pokémon. Case in point, it can completely stop the flow of battle by moving its ribbonlike feelers in a way that charms its opponents into not wanting to fight anymore.</th>

    <th><b>Tepig</b></th>
    <th>Tepig is a Fire Pig Pokémon. It blows fire through...its mouth? Nope... Its ears? That's not right either... Oh, of course - its nose! That skill's not just handy in battle - it also lets Tepig roast its favourite food, berries! Sadly, it sometimes gets a little too excited about the idea and accidentally burns them to a crisp. Ahh, Tepig, you're too adorable!</th>

    <th><b>Togepi</b></th>
    <th>A Fairy-type Pokémon that's always sunny side up! It can siphon positive energy from people and spread it across the world. Its Metronome attack can have a wide variety of effects. Maybe it'll plunge the stage into darkness. Maybe it'll plant damage-dealing seeds on fighters' heads. Whatever it does, Togepi will leave fighters scrambling.</th>

    <th><b>Victini</b></th>
    <th>Victini can create an endless supply of energy and share it with others. Its Victory Star move makes the other fighter who summoned it glow with power from head to toe. As long as they're glowing, their launch ability will shoot up and they'll never flinch. That said, they're not invincible - Victini isn't a miracle-worker.</th>

    <th>For Pikachu's Final Smash, it surrounds itself with a ball of electricity and darts around at high speed, tackling opponents. While it's charging around, press the attack button to unleash powerful sparks. You can also use little ball of light that flies ahead of Pikachu as a guide if it seems out of control!</th>

Also, Wailord can dive to a depth of 3,000 metres on only one breath. That's more than twice the height of Ben Nevis! Some remarkable stats for a remarkable Pokémon.</th>

    <th>The horns on Xerneas's head give this Pokémon the power to bestow eternal life. When summoned in a match, energy will emanate from it and make all fighters glow. Pretty it may be, but this Geomancy move makes everyone much easier to launch. Knowing that, will you take advantage of the situation, or try to stay out of the way?</th>

    <th>This Dark-type Pokémon is a powerful illusionist, and uses its power to confuse any that would threaten its home and loved ones. When it uses its Fury Swipes attack, it vanishes, then reappears next to an opponent and sends them flying into the air. It then slashes at them furiously before slamming them into the ground.</th>

    <th><b>Bald Bull</b></th>
    <th>A 36-year-old Turkish boxer in the prime of his career. His name hints at his bullish nature. In the match itself, you'll see him snort through his nostrils before using his special move, the Bull Charge. Little Mac's going to need to keep all his wits about him to avoid being bowled over by that one.</th>

No one's happier to take a knockout blow from Little Mac than Doc Louis!</th>

    <th>This passionate boxer from Madrid fights in a style reminiscent of a flamenco dancer. His special move Rose Flurry is a burst of hooks followed by a right-handed uppercut. You'll do more than just make his hair stand on end if you land a powerful blow, and the combination of anger and embarrassment will really get him worked up.</th>

    <th>This Final Smash turns Little Mac into a hulking monster of a man. In Punch-Out!! for Wii, Little Mac could take this form by building up the gauge with some well-timed blows. In this game, it seriously powers up his attacks and makes him even faster. He'll completely dominate on the ground, but air battles are outside his weight class.</th>

    <th>Great Tiger is an Indian boxer and a skilled magician. He can float in the air, disappear, make copies of himself - it all seems just a little bit unfair. The audience might start to wonder whether they came to watch a magic show instead of a boxing match! Maybe they should just count themselves lucky that they can see both at once.</th>

    <th>The little guy from Punch-Out!! has come a long way since his humble beginnings fighting the almost literal boxing giants. Above his damage display, you'll notice he has a little meter that fills up as he fights. When it's full, you'll see a flashing "KO" there. That means you can unleash a devastating uppercut!</th>

    <th><b>Little Mac (Alt.)</b></th>
    <th>Little Mac always puts his best fist forward, especially when you use Straight Lunge! You start by charging, then unleash the punch whenever you press the button again. Charge it to the max and its launching power is formidable! Also, attacks won't make you flinch while you're charging or once you've fully charged the move.</th>

    <th><b>Mr. Sandman</b></th>
    <th>This American boxer from Philadelphia is known for his speedy punches and brash, straightforward style. His ring name comes from a German folk tale about a fairy who makes people fall asleep.

    <th>A Russian boxer who loves the delicious taste of soda. He brings whole cases of it to the ringside to drink before each match. And, er...during matches as well. In fact, even after he's been knocked out, he still gropes around for his soda bottle! Try not to let him drink too much, though - that soda helps him recover from your blows!</th>

    <th>At 42, this German boxer is the oldest on the circuit. He may have changed is haircut, but nothing's changed about his habit of shaking his head right before he throws a punch. If you knock him down he'll come back at you with a spinning punch as soon as he gets up again, so stay on your toes!</th>
