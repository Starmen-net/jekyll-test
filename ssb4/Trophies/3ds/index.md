    <th><img src="Able Sisters.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Able Sisters</b></th>
    <th>Able Sisters is a clothing and tailoring shop run by three completely different sisters. The oldest, Sable, quietly sews in the corner. The middle child, Labelle, sells accessories, and the youngest, Mabel, greets customers cheerfully. They fought in the past but have put that behind them!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Beehive.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Beehive</b></th>
    <th>An example of fine architecture constructed by insects, these bees are not shy about defending their hard work. Throw this at an enemy to direct their hate at that player. If the bees are after you, you can shake them for a while with some evasive maneuvers, but they'll track you down.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Blanca.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Blanca</b></th>
    <th>Her smooth face is just like...well, a blank canvas! She used to let people give her a face by drawing on her, but in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, she uses her peculiar face to trick everyone on April Fools' Day. Only a master of disguise like her could mimic other people so convincingly!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Chip.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Chip</b></th>
    <th>For some people, fishing is all about the journey, not the destination. For this beaver, it's all about the destination... because the destination means dinner! If you take him a big fish, he'll congratulate you. Then he'll gobble it down like he hasn't eaten in days. It's...erm...quite a sight.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Copper & Booker.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Copper & Booker</b></th>
    <th>In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, you decide which police officer you'll have in your town based on the type of police station you put up. Will you build the modern police station and hire the brisk, professional Copper? Or perhaps the classic police station and the quiet, nervous Booker?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Digby.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Digby</b></th>
    <th>Isabelle's twin brother, Digby, works at the Happy Home Showcase, but if he needs a quick break, he'll head down to the Roost for a cup of coffee. He takes Blue Mountain, black, no sugar, whereas his sister likes her coffee with a lot of milk and three sugars. For some reason, an order that doesn't include "a lot of milk" sounds more mature.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="DJ KK.png" /></th>
    <th><b>DJ KK</b></th>
    <th>"Yo yo yo! Come rock out at Club LOL! Featuring DJ KK every night of the week (except Saturdays)! Listen to the singer- songwriter bust out a foot-stompin' mix of tunes! Don't forget to come on your birthday for a special treat!" ...That advertisement definitely catches the eye.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Dr. Shrunk.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Dr. Shrunk</b></th>
    <th>Dr. Shrunk definitely has a...unique look about him. As the owner of Club LOL, a new entertainment venue, he isn't shy about taking the stage. It's too bad his jokes don't always fly. If you want a taste of his humor, take him some treats before the show starts!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Franklin.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Franklin</b></th>
    <th>The Harvest Festival, understandably, makes Franklin a little nervous. But in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, he's been invited to cook for everyone. He seems to need help gathering ingredients... Could you spare some time to help? Just to be clear, he isn't one of the ingredients!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Grams.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Grams</b></th>
    <th>The eldest turtle on the tropical island, Grams runs the souvenir counter. She'll trade you island-themed goods in exchange for the medals you earned during tours. Among the things she sells are flower-patterned muumuus, but Leila thinks they look best on Grams.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Gulliver.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Gulliver</b></th>
    <th>Gulliver is a seagull who is not the best sailor, despite dressing the part. You can usually find him shipwrecked on the beach with a bad case of the forgets. If you help him remember where he was headed, he'll set on his travels once more. In time, you'll get a thank-you souvenir!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Isabelle.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Isabelle</b></th>
    <th>Isabelle is the mayor's highly capable secretary. She can be forgetful sometimes, but you can always count on her for information about the town. She wears her hair up in a bun that makes her look like a shih tzu. Mostly because she is one! She also has a twin brother named Digby.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Isabelle (Winter Outfit).png" /></th>
    <th><b>Isabelle (Winter Outfit)</b></th>
    <th>The green check she wears in warmer months suits her perfectly, but when the cold hits, her mustard-yellow cardigan is just too stylish for words. It may make you long for the spring months, though. Hot or cold—nothing makes Isabelle feel under the weather!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Jack.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Jack</b></th>
    <th>Jack, the self-proclaimed czar of Halloween, goes around town saying "Trick or treat!" to everyone he meets! In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, you can see him earlier in October too. Seems like he's looking for a few loyal subjects. Don't you worry—it's all in good fun!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Kapp'n.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Kapp'n</b></th>
    <th>This turtle ferries you out to the tropical island. In the past he's been seen driving a taxi and a bus, and now he's the captain of a little boat. Or maybe he just wanted to sing his songs— it's only right to be sailing while singing sea shanties, after all!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Kicks.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Kicks</b></th>
    <th>Crikey! This shoeshine has really come up in the world. He used to work in a faraway city, but now he runs a shoe store with an impressive collection of shoes to choose from. And you can tell from that sharp-looking hat he's wearing that his is a style you can trust.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Leif.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Leif</b></th>
    <th>Although he's a sloth, there's nothing lazy about Leif. He works hard to sell seeds, saplings, and gardening supplies, all while fighting the temptation to dangle from his plants. I wonder if Leif knows how much all his hard work brightens the days of those around him...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Leila.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Leila</b></th>
    <th>A young lady turtle who plays at running a shop. She's still learning and will buy almost anything from the island. Her prices are much lower than the recycling shop, and her parents hope that the smiling faces of customers will ease her loneliness. Her dad is Kapp'n, and her mom is Leilani.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Leilani.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Leilani</b></th>
    <th>If you've had your fill of tropical- island adventures, Kapp'n's wife, Leilani, can arrange your trip home. She'll also happily sign you up for island tours. Her green skin isn't typical for tropical islanders, and that red hibiscus in her hair really suits her.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Lloid.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Lloid</b></th>
    <th>Gyroids are a common sight in the Animal Crossing series. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, a Gyroid named Lloid dons a helmet and collects funds for public works. The Villager makes use of a rocket-powered Lloid for his side special. The farther he flies, the more powerful his attack will be!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Luna.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Luna</b></th>
    <th>In some parts of the world it's believed tapirs eat dreams, but this one runs the Dream Suite to share dreams. Once you've given her a Dream Address and lain down, she'll send you off to sleep. Soon you'll find yourself in a town worthy of a dream. Enjoy your adventure!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Nat.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Nat</b></th>
    <th>Bugs are like the cream in his tea, the jam on his scone! This old chameleon tasks you with catching him some bugs—for science, really! That lip smacking was just his excitement for din...er...discovery! Go on—find some delectable specimens, won't you? Points and prizes await!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Pavé.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Pavé</b></th>
    <th>Pavé is the Festivale Dancer Extraordinaire! In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, he'll beg—no, DEMAND—you fetch some of those lovely feathers floating around town. If you take him three feathers of the same color, you'll be rewarded with furniture and a dance!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Pete.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Pete</b></th>
    <th>Delivering the mail keeps Pete very busy. He takes great pride in his work, and he sometimes looks like he's in need of sleep. That isn't because he's working too hard— thinking about his crush on Phyllis keeps him up at night! He doesn't let that stop him from getting to work early, though.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Pitfall.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Pitfall</b></th>
    <th>You can plant this in the ground as a trap against your enemies. If they set it off, they'll be rooted in place and at your mercy. If opponents are spending too much time in the air, throwing this at them can send them meteoring down to the ground—or better yet, right off the stage!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Porter.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Porter</b></th>
    <th>Some monkeys prefer the monkey bars, but not Porter—his passion is the train station where he works, and he'll make sure you get to where you're going. He can be a little intense sometimes, but he's a decent guy. Oh, and don't worry—you'll get no monkey business from him.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Redd.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Redd</b></th>
    <th>Redd runs an art gallery...of sorts. He'll try to smooth-talk you into buying his items, but be careful! Occasionally some counterfeit items slip in among the real ones. And by "sometimes" I mean "always." Brushing up on your art history may help you spot the real deal!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Reese & Cyrus.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Reese & Cyrus</b></th>
    <th>From their names, you might guess they're a pair of country singers, but actually they run Re-Tail. Reese sells all kinds of secondhand goods, and Cyrus customizes furniture. They may not be singers, but these exuberant alpacas work together in perfect harmony.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Mr. Resetti.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Resetti</b></th>
    <th>Be sure to save your game before you turn it off, or this guy will show up screaming "AAAAAAAARGH!" Sonny Resetti and his favorite brother, Don, keep an eye out for sudden game resets, and they aren't shy about reminding you to save often. Best not to aggravate them needlessly...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Rover.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Rover</b></th>
    <th>This kitty is very outgoing, always looking to meet and learn about new people. He'll ask you all sorts of questions the first time you meet. Hopefully you don't respond with random nonsense, since you'll be stuck with your answers. Who wants to live in a town called "AAAAAAA," anyway?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Snowpeople.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Snowpeople</b></th>
    <th>When winter finally settles in and snow covers the ground, you get the chance to build a new pal. If you keep rolling those snowballs and putting them together, eventually you'll have one of four friends: Snowman, Snowmam, Snowboy, or Snowtyke. Each one has a wintery surprise!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Timmy & Tommy.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Timmy & Tommy</b></th>
    <th>These twin brothers operate the Nookling stores. Thanks to Tom Nook's teachings, they are just as talented as he is and run Nookling Junction with such success that it can expand several times. Despite their success, they never forget the core value of good customer service.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Tom Nook.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Tom Nook</b></th>
    <th>Currently the owner of Nook's Homes, yes, yes. "Yes, yes" is his favorite catchphrase. Despite all the money he's earned, he'll never lose that down-to-earth charm. With such a friendly demeanor, there's just no way he could be trying to rip you off. So trustworthy, yes, yes!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Tortimer.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Tortimer</b></th>
    <th>A former mayor who is living out his retirement on a tropical island. He's not a hermit, though, and absolutely loves spending time with anyone who goes to visit his tropical paradise. Everyone could learn from his generous spirit. And that aloha shirt looks great!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Tortimer Island.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Tortimer Island</b></th>
    <th>Take a ride on Kapp'n's boat to reach this tropical island, home to fish, insects, and fruit you can't find anywhere else. Tortimer's tours are also available here. Eat the fruit on this stage to reduce your damage, but keep an eye out for the occasional bomb in the mix too!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Villager.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Villager</b></th>
    <th>An energetic young man from a peaceful town in Animal Crossing, he is eager to make his Smash Bros. debut! His Balloon Trip recovery lets him fly like a character from Balloon Fight. The Villager sets out to answer that age-old question: If a tree falls on the battlefield and foes are beneath it, do they get launched?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Villager (Alt.).png" /></th>
    <th><b>Villager (Alt.)</b></th>
    <th>Just a normal girl living a normal life in a normal town—her special moves, however, are anything but. She can pocket items, projectiles, and even beams, and then pull them out at a moment's notice. Her down special lets her plant a tree, water it, and chop it down. If she leaves the tree standing, she can use the axe against foes.</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th><img src="Zipper.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Zipper</b></th>
    <th>This isn't a costume, really! Everyone asks, and the answer is always the same. Please ignore the zipper on the back—that just spoils the magic. This lucky spring fellow appears on Bunny Day, celebrating by asking you to search for bunny eggs. Open up the eggs you find—maybe a prize is inside!</th>

    <th><b>Bayonetta</b></th>
    <th>Bayonetta is one of the last of the near-extinct Umbra Witches clan. She's a master of the Bullet Arts and can use her hair as a conduit to bring forth Infernal Demons. She brings all these skills and more to Smash, where she'll unleash additional damage if you hold the attack button. Damage and distract your foes with this move!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Bayonetta (Alt.).png" /></th>
    <th><b>Bayonetta (Alt.)</b></th>
    <th>If you use Bayonetta's side special in midair, she'll do a diagonal kick upward that goes through platforms. If you press down just before doing the move, it'll turn into a downward attack! Plus, if you hit an enemy in midair, you can use the attack again before you hit the ground–great for combos and recoveries!</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Bayonetta (Original).png" /></th>
    <th><b>Bayonetta (Original)</b></th>
    <th>This Umbra Witch awakens after hundreds of years without any memories of her past life. Usually Bayonetta spends her days pretending to be a nun to lure out angels, until a witch with the same powers as her starts to slowly bring her memories back. She ends up embroiled in a battle to save the world.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="Cereza.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Cereza</b></th>
    <th>A small girl Bayonetta finds wandering the stronghold city of Vigrid with her stuffed toy, Chesire. For some reason, Cereza is convinced Bayonetta is her "mummy" and wants to be just like her. No human should be able to see angels, but somehow Cereza can...</th>

    <th><img src="Jeanne.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Jeanne</b></th>
    <th>An Umbra Witch and old friend of Bayonetta, Jeanne wears a red bodysuit and uses the Bullet Arts fighting style to wield her four pistols, All 4 One. Jeanne saved Bayonetta from the demon Gomorrah but was mortally wounded and had her soul dragged down to Inferno. Bayonetta succeeded in rescuing her friend and returned her soul to its body.</th>

    <th>This shady figure owns the Gates of Hell bar and runs a side business in mysterious objects and powerful weaponry made from the souls of demons. He's known for being a talented gunsmith and counts Bayonetta as a loyal customer, but it's said that if any human uses his wares, they'll suffer a terrible fate...</th>

    <th><b>Cap'n Greenbeard</b></th>
    <th>Lots of vitamin C won't do you much good against the Scurvy Crew. These are some crabby pirates! Even before the Tiki Tak Tribe hypnotized them, these sailors were scary. Just look at that hook! Or that sword! Or that...fork? OK, back to the sword!</th>

    <th>This old man could teach you a thing or two! Cranky Kong has always been willing to share some words of wisdom, but in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, he decides to help directly and brings his cane-swinging style to the field. What a crazy old... Ahem. What a gentleman!</th>

    <th><img src="Diddy Kong.png" /></th>
    <th><b>Diddy Kong</b></th>
    <th>Donkey Kong's trusty partner. He sports his signature look: red hat, red shirt, Rocketbarrel Pack. In Smash Bros., he's incredibly agile. Charge the Rocketbarrel Pack by holding down the button before launch, and you can steer with left and right. Don't forget to drop banana peels—enemies love it!</th>

    <th>Donkey Kong pulls no punches when it comes to fighting. Or headbutts, as it turns out. His Headbutt special move will bury anyone on the ground who gets hit, leaving them open to some serious damage. If Donkey Kong strikes an airborne foe with this move, they'll go crashing downward.</th>

    <th>His name is no joke—this bird is fast! Despite his size, Expresso is light as a feather and loves to glide through the air. In fact, he was too light to hurt enemies at first! He got a little stronger in Donkey Kong Land, and now jumping on foes is a piece of cake!</th>

    <th><b>King K. Rool	</b></th>
    <th>Whereas Mario often squares off against Bowser, Donkey Kong must fight against King K. Rool. He's a big croc with a big attitude...and a tiny crown. He probably could have been Donkey Kong's most trustworthy animal friend. Think he'll ever have a change of heart? Not likely.</th>

    <th><b>Kritter</b></th>
    <th>Kremlings are King K. Rool's minions from the Donkey Kong series, and they come in both green and blue varieties. Green ones will try to bite you repeatedly, and their last bite hurts the most! Blue ones will swipe at you with their sharp claws. Neither really knocks you back, so it's easy to get hit several times by them.</th>
