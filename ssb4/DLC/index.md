Downloadable Content (or DLC), is additional content from the game's initial release, which are used in order to enhance the player’s experience in a game. In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, DLC is divided in three categories: Fighters, Mii Fighter Costumes and Stages. <br /><br />

DLC can be bought either as a bundle for both versions of the game, or for either the Wii U or Nintendo 3DS, depending on the player's choice.

Additional playable fighters can be bought for use in the game, both on single- and multi-player, despite the fact that they can be encountered without being purchased. 
<br /><br />
Mewtwo 

<br /><br />
Originally appearing in Super Smash Bros. Melee, and heavily requested to return by the community, Mewtwo was first announced as the first downloadable fighter during the 50-Fact Extravaganza, released on October 24th 2014, in order to promote the sales of the Wii U version of the game. 6 months later, on April 15th 2015, Mewtwo was made available free of charge for everyone who registered both versions of the game on the now-defunct Club Nintendo rewards program, while it was made available for purchase to anyone on the 28th of the same month.
<br /><br />
Lucas 
<br /><br />
Requested since before the game's release, Lucas was a newcomer to the series in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and was playable from the beginning. Despite Ness being added to the roster during development, the game released without Mother 3’s main protagonist, only being referenced as a Trophy using his model from the previous installment. 
About 6 months after Smash 4’s release, on April 1st 2015, a Nintendo Direct was streamed, beginning with a trailer showing Ness being constantly defeated by various characters, when Lucas “comes out of Nowhere” and is unveiled as an additional fighter. He was released on June 14th of the same year, alongside Ryu and Roy. 
<br /><br />
Ryu & Roy 
<br /><br />
Newcomer Ryu, from Street Fighter, and Melee veteran Roy, from Fire Emblem, were both announced on June 14th 2015 at the end of a Nintendo Direct, and released on the same day alongside Lucas, as a surprise for anyone watching the presentation until the very end. The Suzaku Castle stage is included with Ryu.
<br /><br />  
Cloud 
<br /><br />
Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII was first unveiled on November 12th 2015 during a Nintendo Direct and was later added to the game on December 15th of the same year. The Midgar stage is bundled with him.
<br /><br />
Corrin & Bayonetta 
<br /><br />
Corrin and Bayonetta were both officially unveiled on a Nintendo Direct on December 15th 2015 and were released on February 12th 2016. 
<br />
Corrin was added to the roster in order to promote the then-upcoming Fire Emblem Fates and was bundled with a music track for both versions of the game, while the 3DS version also included exclusive trophies and the Wii U version came with an additional music track. <br />
Bayonetta was voted #1 overall during the Smash Ballot, an event where the community decided on which character they wanted to be added to the roster. She came first in Europe and was in the top 5 in the US. She was bundled with the Umbra Clock Tower stage.
