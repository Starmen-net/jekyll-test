<li>Tripping, an infamous mechanic from Brawl, which dictated that players could have a 1% chance to trip while dashing, has been removed.</li>
<br /><br />
<li>Taunt Cancelling is not present in Smash 4, as it hasn’t been since Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Smash 4’s overall speed is combination of both Melee and Brawl, in an attempt by Sakurai’s team to appeal to both hardcore and casual players</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Target Tests from all previous installments have been removed from Smash 4, and was replaced with Target Blast</li>
<br /><br />

<li>The Masterpieces in Brawl have been revamped in Smash 4. These demos can now be played for longer, starts up immediately as you choose them as opposed to waiting for them to load, and as a bonus, includes Dr. Mario and Kirby’s Dream Land as Game Boy titles to play on the Wii U</li>
<br /><br />

<li>The infamous “Fan” item present in all Smash games, has been removed in Smash 4</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Characters in Smash 4 can no longer glide if they have wings. This includes characters that previously could, that being Pit, Meta Knight, and Charizard</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Most characters from Brawl have faster falling, dash, and air speeds</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Every character is granted 60 frames of invulnerability, meaning “chain-grabs” have been effectively removed</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Unlike Melee, and similar to Brawl, you cannot air-dodge and stop your momentum mid-air, effectively removing a popular technique referred to as “Wavedashing”.
	- L-Cancelling is also not present in Smash 4</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Hitstun cancelling has been toned down. This previously allowed players to freely escape combos as they pleased in Brawl</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Smash 4 is unique as it’s the only game to be regularly patched and updated after release</li>
<br /><br />

<li>A mechanic known as “rage” is introduced in Smash 4. When a player reaches over 35%, their base knockback begins to grow a tiny bit. If the player has 150%, they have 1.15x their base knockback</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Smash 4 has a new feature where characters can be customized to have different special moves and attributes. Every character (excluding DLC) has two different types of moves for every Special Move (ex: Up-B, Side-B, Down-B) for them to equip</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Shields take 19% more damage from attacks, rather than 30% in Brawl. As of Patch 1.1.1, overall shieldstun was increased</li>
<br /><br />

<li>More than one player can grab a ledge in Smash 4, unlike previous installments where only one was allowed</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Boss Battles from Brawl is not present in Smash 4</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Adventure Mode from Melee and Brawl is also not present in Smash 4</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Instead of choosing a difficulty from Very Easy to Very Hard (64/Melee) and Easy to Intense (Brawl), you select Classic Mode/All Star from a difficulty from 1.0-9.0, very similarly to Kid Icarus: Uprising (Funnily enough, another game from Sora, Sakurai’s development team!)</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Some returning characters from Brawl had new voices for Smash 4. These characters include Ness, Kirby, Fox, Falco, Sonic, Pit, Bowser, King Dedede, Lucario, Mewtwo, and Roy</li>
<br /><br />

<li>Smash 4’s art-style is tailored to make characters fit within their home-series games, ditching the realistic look that Brawl introduced</li>
