<li>Lucas had an ability named ‘Call’, where supposedly he would call forest animals to help him in battle.</li>
<li>Gift boxes were present in the game. They can be seen in several <a  href="https - //www.starmen.net/eb64/images/1996/n_Trees_3.jpg">screenshots.</a></li>
<li>When a playable character would faint, they would become a ghost, like in MOTHER 1 & 2. This was not seen in the final version of MOTHER 3 on the GBA.</li>
<li>Wess was a function party member.</li>
<li>There was a screenshot of a strange creature in the water, holding someone captive. The monster is the Kraken and the child is Fuel.</li>
<li>The title screen could be interacted with, similar to the menus in Super Smash Bros Melee and Brawl.</li>
<li>According to Miura Akihiko, the final cut-scene of the game was created 3 months before Space World '99 and the base scenario was also completed.</li>
<li>New Pork City was originally named New Pork Island. It was going to be an amalgamation of EarthBound locations, such as Onett Burger Shop and the Monotoli building.</li>
<li>Like Mother 3, Hot Springs were around in EB64.</li>
<li>Save Frogs were included in this version.</li>
<li>Battle themes would fade in while roaming the overworld as you approached enemies.</li>
<li>Smash attacks also were present. This is evident from a <a  href="smaaaash.jpg">picture taken at Spaceworld '99.</a> While small, it is clearly the series' iconic "SMAAAASH" text.

<li>No DD expansion for the cart was ever in production. IGN had sparked a rumor about 3.5, but it was false.</li>

<li>PSI was referred to as Magic in-game and in publications, but this could be do the PSI being a new phenomenon to the villagers.</li>
<li>Despite the appearance and rumors, Ness was never planned for the game. Early screenshots, which showed a Ness look-a-like, featured an early design for Claus.</li>
<li>There was a contest held during Spaceworld '97 and the winner would be featured in EB64. The winner was a child named Hiroki, but his role in the story is unknown. There was <a  href="https - //starmen.net/eb64/images/1998/Hiroki-Chan.jpg">a screenshot</a> featuring his likeness and Dengeki had featured his missing persons poster in their <a  href="https - //starmen.net/eb64/publications/Dengeki_Nintendo_64_Issue_19_December_1997_PG94.png">magazine</a> as well.</li>
<li>According to the segment, MOTHER 3 Times, in <a  href="https - //starmen.net/eb64/publications/Dengeki_Nintendo_64_18_November_1997-PG86.jpg">issue 18 Dengeki Nintendo 64</a>, the song "Bon Voyage Amigo" was confirmed to be in this version of the game.</li>
