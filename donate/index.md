<p>Starmen.Net always has and always will be a non-profit site. When Tomato 
and reidman started this site, their goal was to create a center for EarthBound 
fans on the internet. Never did they think that it would become something 
this huge, nor this expensive. Everyone who works on this site is a 
volunteer and gets no monetary payment or compensation for their work, 
nor has anyone ever been paid in the past. All of the money goes to 
paying for the server bills, software, registration fees, and 
miscellaneous other costs related to running the website such as printing costs, <a href="http://starmen.net/merchandise/smn/mugz0rz.php">prizes</a>, shipping costs, etc.</p>

<p>When the funds are running low, we do lots of cool things for fundraisers, including auctions and fundraisers. You can find some of our many donor rewards from past donation drives in the <a href="/merchandise">Merchandise</a> section.
We've also got the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/starmen">Starmen.Net Store</a>, which, thanks to <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=ppost&toi=137">Jonk</a>, has been successful 
beyond anyone's best expectations. Our profit margin from the Starmen.Net store is fairly meager, though, and it is for 
this reason that donations have been and always will be our biggest and 
best source of money for the website.</p>

<p>Because of the pain associated with having a separate bank account 
and tax numbers for the website, I manage Starmen.Net's funds from a Paypal account and with a simple spreadsheet to track donations and expenses. This is the reason that 
checks/money orders are made out to me, Reid Young, instead of 
Starmen.Net. I cannot legally accept checks or money orders made out to 
Starmen.Net.</p>

<p>No one is obligated to donate to Starmen.Net. Lots of volunteer work goes into the website, though, so if you're 
not much for art, writing, or coding, another great way of helping is to donate.</p>

<p>The largest majority of donations to Starmen.Net are from $10 to $20. 
People have in the past, however, donated as little as 2 cents (thanks 
Aquas) and as much as $4,000+ (for more information on that particular 
donor, check out the <a href="#giovanni">Giovanni section</a> ;) There is no upper or lower limit to donations, though.</p>

<p>Now for the good stuff; making a donation isn't an entirely thankless 
process, trust me. We at Starmen.Net can't do a whole lot with just a 
website, but we'll do our best to thank you in any way possible. Here is 
what you can get for your donation:</p>

<p>Crazy as it sounds, yes, there <i>can be</i> drawbacks to donating (with 
the obvious exception that you lose a chunk of money ;) Please note that 
I said there COULD be drawbacks; it depends entirely on your 
attitude.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will try to use their status as Starmen.Net donors to 
sort of give themselves a high status on the forum or in the community. 
This is a bad thing, because it will only make people dislike you. If 
you flaunt your badge and constantly make allusions to how much money 
you spend on the site, people are really going to get sick of you. 
Please keep this in mind, because being a donor doesn't guarantee that 
people are going to love you. Acceptance isn't something you can buy, 
but its not that hard to earn here. Just a friendly word of warning to 
be yourself and to avoid trying to artificially inflate your status in 
the community. Be helpful, be concise, use grammar and spelling, and 
most importantly of all, be friendly. THESE things will gain you 
acceptance and friendship.</p>
<p>Also, please note that being a donor doesn't give you any special 
privileges beyond the cool stuff that you get. We won't hire you as a 
staffer. We won't make you a moderator on the forum. We won't necessarily 
use your ideas (although we <em>will</em> listen more carefully because 
people who donate often care much more about the site than normal 
visitors). Please keep this in mind, and don't try to use donations to 
bend rules; you're under the same rules as everyone else.</p>

<p>We love Giovanni because he donated over $4,000 in the early years of the website.
The first time Reid got one of his massive donations, which was around $250, his
mom freaked out and thought he 
was running some kind of money laundering scheme. It took him 15 
minutes to explain to her that Giovanni wasn't a loan shark or 
something. Of course, that was back in 1999 or something - in these modern
days, we all know that Giovanni is actually a powerful political figure
in the South American continent.</p>
<p>Gio has been coming to the site for a long time and really enjoys his 
time on the forum and the chatroom, which is why (we think) he supported 
us like he did. Rumor is that he is a 90 year old man similar in 
appearance to Rich Uncle Pennybags from the Monopoly games, but in truth 
we're not really sure. We just know he's generous.</p>
