<p>Thank you for your donation, it looks like it made it through safely! You'll get a receipt in your email. If you sent a payment via Paypal, you can log into your account at paypal.com to view the details. Depending on how busy he is, reidman will hopefully have your badge added in a day or two. As for the other donor rewards, you'll have to take a little initiative to claim them:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you donated enough to earn a <b>rank</b> ($10 or more), contact reidman and let him know what you want it to be. It's gotta be less than 5 words!</li>
<li>If you donated enough to earn an <b>avatar</b>, you can request one on our awesome <a href="http://starmen.net/forum/?t=msg&th=19940">Fanvatar Factory</a> in the Fan Forum.</li>
<li>If you donated enough to earn an <b>email account</b>, contact reidman and let him know two things:
<ul>
<li>What do you want your username to be (i.e. superdood@starmen.net)?</li>
<li>Do you want a full-fledged email account that you can log in and check, or just a forwarder (i.e. yourname@starmen.net forwards email to yourname@gmail.com)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can reach reidman at <a href="mailto:reidman@starmen.net">reidman@starmen.net</a>, or just <a href="http://starmen.net/forum/?t=ppost&toi=8">send him a Private Message</a> on the forum.</p>

<p>Thanks again, we really appreciate your help!</p>
