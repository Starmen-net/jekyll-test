<b><u>An Extra with Nothing to Say</u></b> by <i>Frau Landers</i>-  Duster's disappearance from his descent of the Osohe sewers is mysterious and unknown. What exactly went on in those 3 long years that had him forget his mission, his training, and his family? How did he end up as a bassist in the hip band DCMC? What did he do with the Hummingbird Egg, and how did he safely transfer it? All of these questions are addressed in the focus on the most famous master of the Thief Arts as An Extra with Nothing to Say!
