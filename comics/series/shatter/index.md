<b><u>MotherBound: Shattered Reality</u></b> by <i>Mercurial Magypsy</i> - Ness, the hero who saved Earth from Giygas, wakes up to another day, only to find out that itâ€™s not just another day. All of time and space has gone out of whack, the world is a dark realm of floating rocks, shadowy monsters are everywhere, and nothing makes sense anymore. Who, or what, could have caused this chaos? And who are these new people joining Ness on his quest? Can the Chosen Four, along with heroes of the Past and Future, find out the cause of all this and set things right? Can they repair the Shattered Reality?
