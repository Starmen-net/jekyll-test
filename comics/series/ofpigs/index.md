<b><u>Of Pigs and Masks</u></b> by <i>Aangie</i>- The evil Porky has melded time and space to his will in order to take revenge on his nemesis and overthrow the world. However, he has a slightly softer side to him deep down. With the Masked Man by his side, how much mischief lies inside the childish mind of the Pig King? Plenty, of course!
