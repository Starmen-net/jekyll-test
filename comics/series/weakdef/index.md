<b><u>A Weak Defense</u></b> by <i>matilda_caboose</i> -  While many comics attempt to tell the whole EB story, none have ever made it to the most decisive battle of all.  Caboose skips forward here to relay the epic battle between Giygas and the Chosen Four that's certain to give you tingles down your spine.
