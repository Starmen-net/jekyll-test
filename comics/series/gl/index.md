<b><u>Gaia's Lament</u></b> by <i>Artemis251</i>- Many years after the fateful encounter with an alien being and beyond the chaos the earth saw with the ultimate evil entity, Giygas, comes a new unforseen threat.  Pokey, having escaped the battle with Giygas through time, saw a bleak future, but little did he know at the time how involved he would be in this event.  As new foes emerge, what will fate allow to arise as Mother Earth sadly watches by the sidelines?
