<p>The Funfest is an event that used to be held at Starmen.Net multiple times yearly. This year for the holiday season we've decided to bring it back! The Funfest is, basically, a chance for people to be creative and show off their abilities. Anyone may participate, and may submit as many items as they come up with. The idea is for you to do what you're best at and what you have fun doing. For example, artists may want to draw a cool picture. People with decent writing skills may want to try their hand at a fanfic.</p>
<p><b>This Years Theme:</b></p>
<p>ALL WINTER/FALL HOLIDAYS! Celebrate Halloween, Thanksgiving, New Years Day, <a href="/matsuri">Earthbound no Matsuri</a>, or even Canadian Boxing Day, anything you like!</p>
<p><b>What to Submit:</b></p>
<p>There are no real limitations to what type of files you submit. Here are some suggestions:<ul><li>Fanfic (.txt .doc .html)</li><li>Poem/Song (.txt .doc .html .wav .mp3)</li><li>Music (.xm .it .mid .mp3 .wav)</li><li>Fanart (.gif .jpg .png)</li><li>Multimedia (Flash, Shockwave, VRML, .avi .mpg)</li></ul> Please keep in mind that these are not the only files that can be submitted. However, all files submitted MUST fit under the theme for the funfest. This Funfest's theme - All Holidays!. Entries that don't fit the theme at all won't be eligible for any prizes, so don't stray off course!</p>
<p><b>Judging</b></p>
<p>So whats in it for the people who participate? Well, not only do they get a chance to show off their talents to all the visitors to Starmen.Net, they also have a shot at winning prizes.</p>
<P>Several staff members shall judge the entries. There shall be four major categories to be judged and to win prizes in: <UL>

<p>Now the important part. This section will give you all the information you'll need to know so you can be sure your submission gets to us properly. </p>
<p>First off, this time around, we're using a submission format. So read the guidlines before you send that stuff off. If you have any problems with the submission form, send them to <A href="mailto:funfest@starmen.net">funfest@starmen.net</A>.</p>
