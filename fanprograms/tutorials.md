Ding ding ding! Class is now in session! So you're ready to enter the magical land of coding and software development? Well... it's not all candy canes and lollipops, no sir. In fact it's such a hassle there's a section here devoted specifically for guiding you through your first big step: learning a programming method. Now there's several routes here, and which you choose ultimately depends on your project and your own goals. You can start entirely from scratch, for instance, with some sort of basic coding language. On the other hand it may be easier to pick up a program with tools already built in for you to use.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to contribute a tutorial either <a href="http://starmen.net/forum/?t=ppost&toi=3404">PM</a> it or <a href="/submit">submit</a> it to the site (make sure to submit into the "Fan Games / Apps" section) as a simple note/wordpad file.
