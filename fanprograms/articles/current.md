Welcome to the Developer's Corner! Think of this place as a bulletin board for programmers and game designers. Here you'll find all sorts of useful tips and information--shared knowledge to help you get started on your own project or to even further hone your skills.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to post an article either <a href="http://starmen.net/forum/?t=ppost&toi=3404">PM</a> what you'd like posted or <a href="/submit">submit</a> it to the site (make sure to submit into the "Fan Games / Apps" section) as a simple note/wordpad file.<br />
<br />
Past archived articles can be found <a href="/fanprograms/articles/archives.php">here</a>.

A few things to keep in mind:
<ul>
 <li><b>You shouldn't ever <i>have</i> to reinvent the wheel</b>, unless you are doing it to educate yourself or to make drastic improvements to said wheel.</li>
 <li><b>Comment your code!</b></li> <!-- like this! you win 1 NerdPoint(TM) for spotting me! -->
 <li><b>You have to be able to figure things out on your own</b>; while there are plenty of people on the internet willing to give you tips, you can't expect them to do everything for you, and you won't learn anything by doing so.</li>
 <li><b>Search engines are your friend.</b> It's highly unlikely that your burning question has never been asked before; look around, there is an incredible wealth of programming tutorials, reference manuals, and support on the internet.</li>
 <li>Start small, and apply your knowledge.</li>
 <li>You are going to spend a very large chunk of your time debugging (fixing) your code. Get yourself some good tools for debugging, and make friends with them.</li>
</ul>
