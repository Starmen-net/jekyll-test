The <b>Downloads</b> page is your almost-one-stop center for nearly everything you need to start PK Hacking.  Here you'll find programs to hack the game, bits and pieces that other users have made for public use, documentation formatted for local storage, and all sorts of other good stuff.  It's also the premier database of EarthBound hacks available on the Internet, period.<br /><br />

<b>IMPORTANT</b>: For legal reasons, Starmen.Net <b>cannot</b> and <b>will not</b> host the EarthBound ROM itself or post links to it.  Sorry, but there's really nothing we can do about it if we don't want Nintendo kicking reidman in the head.  Your best option is going to be to run a <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" alt="google google google">Google</a> search.  (That's why we said "almost-one-stop.")
