This section houses the key programs used for EarthBound hacking.  The collection has shrunk substantially since earlier eras with the advent of AnyoneEB's Java-based version of PK Hack (formerly JHack), but there are still several to choose from.  Each has a detailed description of exactly what it is, and all its bells and whistles.<br /><br />

Problem with a program?  Find a bug?  Check out the Technical Troubleshooting topic on our message board to try to find a solution.  When making a post, please be sure to include what operating system you're running under, what you were doing, and what happened in as specific detail as possible.

<b><a href="util/JHack.05e.jar.zip">PK Hack (version 0.5.14)</a></b> - 2.16 MB, .zip compressed<br /><hr />
PK Hack is the Alpha and the Omega - the premier EarthBound hacking utility available anywhere.  If you have any intention of hacking EarthBound, this program is an absolute Must Have.  No exceptions.  As opposed to previous versions, PK Hack v0.5+ is programmed in Java using a modular design.  Since it's so easy, PK Hack is being constantly updated and expanded by the community with new features and capabilities.  Text editing, graphics editing, items and enemies, maps and statistics, and virtually everything else under the sun fall within this incredible program's grasp.<br /><br />

Bear in mind that, as was said, PK Hack v0.5+ runs under Java.  As such you'll need a recent version of the <a href="http://java.com">Java Runtime Environment</a> in order for it to operate properly. For more information on PK Hack's evolution, recent updates, source code, and more information on enabling Java, visit AnyoneEB's page at <a href="http://www.anyoneeb.net:83/jhack/">http://www.anyoneeb.net:83/jhack/</a>.<br /><br />

<b><a href="util/mapedit5_beta.exe">EarthBound Map Editor (version 5.b - Beta release)</a></b> - 350 KB, Self-Extracting .exe<br /><hr />
This is the latest beta version of the new-and-improved Map Editor 5, which is a complete overhaul of the original Map Editor 4.x codebase. It doesn't currently have the ability to save, but it gives a glimpse of what this editor will become in the near future.  The 4.x (and older) versions of the Map Editor are functional, but have some nasty problems with ROM compatibility and should not be used. Use the map editor that comes with PK Hack instead.

{% include box-open.html box-id="909" title="Emulation Programs:" author-id="191" timestamp="2005-04-04 11:33:05 +0500" type="norm" dbname="box31981" last-modified-by="127" %}
In order to run the EarthBound ROM, you'll need an emulation program that simulates the hardware in an SNES console.  Because the programmers of said programs are always updating them, and we're too lazy to host all of the ports they've made, here are some links to the ones we reccommend.<br /><br />

<b><a href="http://www.zsnes.com/" target="blank">zSNES</a></b> - PK Hack preferred!<br /><hr />
For various reasons, zSNES is the preferred emulator of many PK Hackers.  It is also currently the only emulator compatible with Mr. Accident's <a href="./down_util.php#patchman">PatchMan</a> program.<br /><br />
<b><a href="http://sapporo.cool.ne.jp/rzsnes/" target="blank">Returner's zSNES (RzSNES)</a></b> - zSNES enhanced with memory viewer<br /><hr />
RzSNES is an enhanced version of zSNES that allows the user to view changes to the system's memory as it happens.  This is useful for hackers doing advanced programming, so they can see what their code is doing in the bowels of the SNES.  The site is partially in Japanese, but don't let that throw you - the emulator is entirely in English.<br /><br />
<b><a href="http://snes9x.com/" target="blank">SNES9X</a></b> - That other one.<br /><hr />
The jury's still out on which is better, SNES9X or zSNES.  More than anything it's a matter of what you tried first, and what you're used to.  Try it out if you're feeling adventurous and what to see what works for you best.  As mentioned above, please note that SNES9X is not compatible with Mr. Accident's <a href="./down_util.php#patchman">PatchMan</a> program.

<b><a href="util/ebsavestate31.exe">EB Savestate Editor (version 3.1)</a></b> - 629 KB, Self-Extracting .exe<br /><hr />
The EB Save State Editor is a handy tool that allows you to open and modify the save states created by the ZSNES emulator. Change names, stats, items, and toggle event flags at will! Also supports custom event-flag descriptions for assisting in debugging the event flow of your hacks.  There are a lot of hidden easter eggs stashed away in this program too, so look hard enough and you might find something amusing. ;)
<br /><br />
<a name="patchman" /><b><a href="util/patchman11.exe">PatchMan (version 1.1)</a></b> - 940 KB, Self-Extracting .exe<br /><hr />
PatchMan is a patch management utility. It creates a database containing all your .IPS patch files, and applies them to ROMs automatically at the click of a button. No more copying and renaming ROMs when you want to play somebody's hack - just add the patch to the database and you can play it at any time with a single click.
<br /><br />
<b><a href="util/PSIAnim2.zip">EB PSI Animation Editor (version 2.2b - Beta release)</a></b> - 91.1 KB, .zip Compressed<br /><hr />
The PSI Animation editor is a fun tool that allows you to edit most of the PSI Animations in Earthbound. You can really make whatever you want - there's endless possibilities with full arrangement editing.  Tile graphics and pallet editing are not supported yet, but may be at some time down the line.  Also, remember that this is a Beta release, so be sure to make plenty of backups of your ROM, just in case!
<br /><br />
<b><a href="util/tlp.zip">Tile Layer Pro</a></b> - 226 KB, .zip Compressed<br /><hr />
You probably won't have an immediate use for this utility. It allows you to directly edit the image data in any SNES ROM. As it isn't directly designed for EarthBound, you might need a bit of help using it. Before you attempt it, first check and see if PK Hack is capable of making the graphical edit you're attempting.
