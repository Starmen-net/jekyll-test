Pretty much all I have right now are the <a href="http://starmen.net/pkhack/images/ebrent/ebrssite.rar">extremely awesome out-of-battle sprites by EBrent</a> from <a href="http://www.thingsbybrent.com/sprites/">the website he made</a>. You can use them. You should give him credit! You don't have to if you really don't want to. But you really should. They're all in that thing there.
