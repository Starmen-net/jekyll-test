<center><font size="5">2.0 Tileset and Map Editing</font></center><br /><font size="2">It is time to get into the hard part of hacking, editing that map. This section will cover everything related to
editing the map, from making a tileset, to setting up all the details of the map. This is the major stumbling block for most would-be hackers, and takes tons of time to do well. This is important to learn though, otherwise you will be limited to graphical, sound, or text hacks, or helping others with their hacks. You will probably never find someone willing to do your map hacking for you, given how hard and time intensive it is. Those who do know how to edit the map are usually working on their own hack, or the current group hack like the EarthBound Zero remake. Itâ€™s worth the time it takes to learn, and worth the time it takes to make your own tilesets and areas of the map. The most impressive hacks will have their own custom tilesets.</font>
