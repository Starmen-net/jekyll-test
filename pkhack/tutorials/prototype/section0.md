So you decided to alter the EarthBound ROM. Maybe you want to translate it into Arabic. Maybe
you wanna make the game harder, add a new area, or use it to propose to that special someone. Well, you are in luck, a program by the name of JHack gives you the tools needed to do nearly anything you can think of with the EarthBound ROM.
<br /><br />
This tutorial will take you through how to use each of the tools inside of JHack, so you will know what you can do with the program. I’ve included many pictures to help better explain what I’m talking about, and to help make it easier for new hackers to learn how.
