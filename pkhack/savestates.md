Here's a couple useful savestates for you enterpreneur-type ROM Hackers!<br /><br />

<b>Debug Savestates</b>:<br /><br />

<a href="http://starmen.net/pkhack/pk_junk/savestates/debugmenukirby.zst">Kirby Debug Menu</a> - An odd debug menu which is the mother of all others. Has potential to test weird things like sounds and map.<br />
<a href="http://starmen.net/pkhack/pk_junk/savestates/debugmenuextra.zst">Secondary Debug Menu</a> - An in-game debug menu with the abilities to test misc. events, change flags, test the Coffee scene, etc.<br />
<a href="http://starmen.net/pkhack/pk_junk/savestates/debugmenuold.zst">Main Game Debug Menu</a> - An in-game menu which was the first debug menu found in EB. With it, you can change your stats, weapons, characters, etc. It's highly recommended that you use <a href="http://starmen.net/pkhack/pk_junk/hack/DEBUG.IPS">this patch</a> to translate the menu first.<br /><br /><br />

<b>Misc. Savestates:</b><br /><br />

<a href="http://starmen.net/pkhack/pk_junk/savestates/pumpedup.zst">Pumped Up Stats</a> - A savestate where all characters have 160 on all stats and the best equipment at level 50 with 999 HP and PP. Starts in Ness's bedroom.

To use a savestate, get the <a href="http://starmen.net/pkhack/pk_junk/down_util.php">ZSNES</a> emulator and rename the savestate you want to use the same name as the ROM and in the same directory. After that, you can hit F3 to choose a savestate and F4 to load.

Well, dude. There really aren't many save states here right now, and I highly doubt there ever were. If you have an interesting or cool savestate for a hack or a unique, helpful situation in EB, <a href="http://starmen.net/submit">send it vaguely in our general direction</a> and we'll be on it like a pack of rabid cheetahs on ice. Until then, <i>I am Batman.</i>
