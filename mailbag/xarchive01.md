The topic for this week's mailbag was:
<p />
<b>Yup, It's Coming!</b> - Okay, so it was just a topic on the official nintendo.com message board by one of the NOA guys, but it's fired everyone up with EarthBound rerelease frenzy like never before.  I wanna hear from all the oldschoolers who've been waiting so long for this, from all the new folks who came looking for more EarthBound and found our site, and from anyone and everyone else.  Heck, I'd even like incognito letters from those crazy NOA guys, if they're reading this - don't worry, I won't reveal your secret identities!  If you can't trust your old pal Simon, who <i>can</i> you trust?
<p />
Well sir, if those NOA guys sent in letters, they disguised their identities <i>really</i> well.  But that's okay, they probably get enough mail to send answers to that they don't need to send out more letters to me.  I'd rather get letters from my pals the regs anyway!

<p />
I think All I have to say honestly was what I said in my post.
<p />
"What's so Special About Earthbound?
<p />
Well, that's a good question. First of all, its a good enough game to inspire someone to create an account just for the sake of posting and opinion in this topic.
<p />
Earthbound is truly an RPG like no Other. The quirky graphics, The Great soundtrack with songs that stick with you, The Not so typical storyline, The Characters Both Playable and non playable... all layered gently atop the deep rooted underlying Message of love and friendship.
<p />
I played Earthbound back in the day, when it first came out... I never wanted to put it down. I played and played and played that game, and when I finished, I started all over again. Though Nothing was different my second (and many to follow) times through, the game never once lost that special something it has. I've played my fair share of RPGs... I've played my Ultimas... My Dragon Warriors..... My Final fantasy's.....My Suikodens.... My Star Oceans..... My SaGa Frontiers..... My Tales of _______s ..... and many MANY more countless RPGs.....None Of them, even for a moment, lived up to the magic of Earthbound.
<p />
As Time went on, I only grew fonder of the game, even ordered the Mother 2 soundtrack from some Music shop online. I've done Fan Art, Fan comics For the series. In SSB and SSBM My character of choice is Ness, and more than likely you'll see Saturn ringer among my many titles after a brawl. Of course I worked until I got the chosen 4, mister Saturn and starman trophies. (but that's beside the point)
<p />
When I heard Earthbound 64 was Scrapped, I was pretty upset... But not defeated. It was at this time I stumbled across Starmen.net, I signed their Mother 3 petition (one of the 31338 signatures) and it took me awhile, but I finally decided to become a member of their Online community as well.
<p />
When I heard of the GBA Mother 1+2...It was like a shining new hope for me that maybe Id get to relive my old days with Earthbound, As well as the game that came Before it. However, that was not to be... Months passed, and email after email continually gave me the same response "We don't have any plans to release that game at this time, but keep watching".
<p />
To tell you the truth, that makes me mad. Nintendo gives service to Zelda fans, Mario Fans, Resident Evil Fans, Pikmin fans...the list goes on and on.... But from us Earthbounders They Get A petition, Numerous letters, a ENTIRE website FILLED with people, and we are just going ignored. That's just not fair.
<p />
To sum it all up... Earthbound is not your typical RPG.... its something more....its something different for everyone who plays it....theres a certain magic and a certain charm, that's so strong that it drives fans almost 10 years later, to make petitions, to write letters, to band together and say "Hey, it may be weird... But this is our game... Our sanctuary".... Earthbound just isn't something you can be told about... Its an Experience.
<p />
Maybe someday, Nintendo will see beyond the sales of 10 years ago and give us another shot with the Mother Series...
<p />
Maybe with the Announcement of mother 3, They'll give us our chance with the Mother Trilogy.
<p />
Here's to hoping.
<p />
-Andrew "
<p />
10 years, and us Earthbounders only go stronger than ever... Now that's what I call a good game.

<p />
This "Topic", as you call it, seems to have made everyone excited.  My friend called me and it sounded as if he was jumping up and down after reading it.   But I say, IT IS JUST A FORUM TOPIC BY NOA EMPLOYEES!  We don't even know if they actually have knowledge about EarthBound.  And, with my luck, EarthBound 2/Mother 3 will either be delayed until after my death or be cancelled, just like the other 3 games I have patiently awaiter for.  I am beginning to think Nintendo hates me.  What about you?  Do you think Nintendo hates me?
<p />
- Tre
<p />
<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center>
<p />
Heh, if they really hate anyone, it's gonna be reid and Tomato for building the community in the first place, or Giovanni for funding them.  I figure they'll eventually have to say, "HERE'S your freakin' game!" just to shut us up.
<p />
As for it being "just a forum topic," we're EarthBound fans.  We take what we get.  Other games get plenty of attention, so when a snippet about our favourite subject shows up, we pounce on it like rabid half-starved cougars on a decaying buffalo corpse.  And speaking of corpses, if Nintendo can really delay the game until after you die, they're a lot more patient than any of us.

<p />
I have been waiting for Mother 3 since 1998 and anticipated an American release of Mother 1+2 ever since I saw the commercial from Japan. Along the way I patiently waited through three petitions that hoped to get a new Mother game released on our shores that went virtually unnoticed by Japan. I kept my hopes up after hearing of Mother 3's cancellation and still look forward to some form of it being released in the future, no matter how little news we hear about it. I don't think the topic in the Nintedo.com forum will have a big impact on Earthbound/Mother rereleases/new releases in the US, but who knows what it may lead to. The topic already has a good number of pages. Even if no more games in the series make it here, I'll still import any released in Japan. I'm still hoping for a US Mother 1+2 release and for a localized Mother 3 when it comes out.

Your comment on importing got me thinking: we should make a video game that gets really popular in Japan and then frustrate them by not releasing the sequel for years and years and see how <i>they</i> like it.

<p />
Wow. That thread sure is causing an uproar, huh?
<p />
Well, my whole opinion on this fiasco is this: They brought the fight to their doorstep, and it ain't gonna stop until we get Mother 3 or Earthbound on GBA. It seems like this fight is gonna go all the way, and the SM.net demands are finally going to be met, one way or another.

I think this is about more than just our site now, Kent.  This is about <i>all videogamers</i> needing Mother 3!  I fully expect it to get Game of the Year from GamePro, IGN, and Penny Arcade.

<p />
I don't believe it. I don't think it'll ever get released. I think Nintendo is going to hunt down every copy of EarthBound, every rom, every illegal rom of EB0, every hacked xbox with these games on them, every american earthbound cart (plus those two I saw in Jamaica that one time) plus all copies of any mother games found outside Japan, along with every non-Japanese EarthBound/Mother fan... pile them all into a huge mountain, and set them all on fire. Then they will dance on our bodies, yelling "Write letters telling US what to do, will ya, ya filfthy American infidels? Hahahaha! We have your money!"
<p />
Maybe Squaresoft will have compassion on us and make sure we get sent so we don't become fiends. I mean, they know how Nintendo can be toward their fans.
<p />
We will have to start an underground railroad for earthbound cart smuggling if that ever happens. And then maybe we can us eli whitney's cotton gin to distribute illegal cotton copies of EB0.

Your logic is inconsistent.  They'd have MORE of our money if they released Mother 3, and the PK Hackers have enough copies of EB0 to sink the Bismark.  Not that Starmen.Net condones or endorses any sort of ROM possession, of course!

I posted on the NP forum topic (and it took me a long time, dangit!) but I'm a little pessimistic. I'm not sure exactly how much influence the NOA forum moderators have in Nintendo and whether or not the people that actually decide to bring or not bring Mother 1+2, 3 to the U.S. will be affected by this. But considering the large number of other methods the sm.net community have resorted to in order to get Nintendo's attention, this latest development may finally convince Nintendo that it is worthwhile to release another EarthBound game here in the States.

See, I was under the impression that NOA forum mods were selected from the ranks of either NOA itself, or at least Nintendo Power.  Remember, Dan Owsen was a wildly prolific translator (and the original voice of Fox McCloud) before he became "Ask Dan."  Undoubtedly, more than a few NOA higher-ups are aware of the mad EB love goin' around.

i think nintendo is gonna release Mother 3 on its 10 year anniversary, that IS in 2006 right? and im not just some crazy hobo who got to the Computer in a neighbors house. yeah the announcement was made in 1996 for Mother 3....bah who knows.but perhaps if we keep writing in that perticular message board for Earthbound nintendo will accually say "oh hey, people want this game , lets pull our 10 year old translation out again and give them what they want". if it comes in a HUGE box with a guide i'll be Happy.

Hi,
<p />
Porting EB to GBA was one great thing done by the Nintendo guys. It would be fully complete if they would just take the time to look for some people who have actually played the original game to translate it. I'm saying this because if you played Shining Force on Genesis and the ported version for GBA you'll know the problem. The translations were pretty bad. Why can't Nintendo do it right for the first time with Earthbound, one of the most popular games on the SNES. Can't they find some people who are willing to work on the translations for like 3 weeks or more? And with the new Mother 3, maybe they'll get some new brains for their new year and they get the idea to also release it in the US, I live in Europe but I'm sure I'll order it from the States. Hopefuly Ape inc. will see the success this game has and decide to make the canceled N64 version on the DS. Nobody would complain about that, right? Anyway this was it for now. Many greetz to you all.

To play EarthBound in English on my GBA, I'd pay sixty bucks Canadian maybe.  Hopefully it'll be a little cheaper than that.  C'mon, I'm crazy, not stupid.

Greetings from everybody's favorite breaded ichthyoid.
<p />
As far as I see it, any interest in the EB series is good.  Any interest on a board maintained by the people we want to make/translate/release M3 is even better.  While EB never was as popular or successful as some of their main series (and it's arguable whether we'd actually want it to be that popular), the more obvious interest and success potential there is for the game, the more likely it is that we'll see Mother 3 here in the US.
<p />
The other nice thing about such a topic is that it's giving Starmen.net a ton of shameless plugs, with the potential for a good group of new members.  We need more people to brainwash and form angry mobs with at any news of a delay of M3.  (Did I say "brainwash?"  I meant "teach in a caring manner so that they may be accepted into the fold that is Starmen.Net!")
<p />
Speaking of shameless plugs, go visit EBDB.  Seeing all those hits is good for my ego :)

I'd go, but you totally forgot the link.  Please rectify this next week!  Also: popularity is one of those things that varies from person to person.  I think EB could benefit from a little more time in the limelight, really.  It's hard to start conversations about it with my buddies when all they've played is FF10.

Mother 3..... I have been waiting so long for the moment when I would hear it's in development. Well, okay, not that long, (I only beat the original last year) but I'm still really looking forward to it.

Random thought: How the heck did the Mr. Saturns build the Phase Distorter if they have no hands?!? Did they just do it all by PSI?? Or did they sit back and let Andonuts and Apple Kid do all the work?? Lazy little manipulators...

The site will be entering a golden age. Many more people will join the site, and our dreams of an EarthBound rerelease and Mother 3 release will eventually come true, if this keeps up.

I was wondering though, I would like to know about the history of the website.

Basically, reid started YANEB (You Are Now EarthBound) back in 1995, when the Internet was nothing but precious rocks at the Smithsonian and some dinosaur pictures.  Then he took over earthbound.net with Tomato, which later became starmen.net.  I'm skipping a thing or two from the horrific War of the Guinea Pigs but you can pick that up later.

I'm so intensely pumped about EarthBound's possible reincarnation for a modern day system that my entire body is convulsing with excitement.  Seriously, Simon, this is one of those feelings that I get only when something extraordinary is about to happen.  Baby, darling, don't let me down on this one.
<p />
Honestly.  Somehow I want all of this to be true, but I have a feeling that it's exactly like everything else that's ever happened regarding EarthBound in the past ten years with the exception of Mother 1+2 being rereleased for the GBA in Japan even though that doesn't even matter considering I'm not that Japanese at all and I can't speak the language so it seems like everything is just one constant disappointment and my life is FULL OF CONSTANT SORROW.

I know exactly how you feel.  You're so completely pumped, you've got the shakes <i>before</i> you drink your morning coffee, and then you drink it anyway, so everything looks fuzzy because your eyes can't focus.  That's why I've compiled this list of other awesome stuff you can look forward to while you wait for the inevitable EarthBound greatness to hit the shores:
<p />
<ol>
<li>The Super Bowl is coming up next weekend, and that's a great excuse to party even if you scoff at those wussy Americans with their four downs and their fair catches.  C'mon, you get 40 seconds instead of 20 to make a play!  Give me a break!</li>
<li>Two weeks until March Madness.  You know you love college basketball, especially when Duke loses to some scrappy eighth-seeded team.  Duke sucks.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/main.html">Hitchhiker's Guide</a> movie totally hits in May.  Put on your favourite housecoat and go as Arthur Dent.</li>
<li>And of course, the Tour de France is all through July.  I know!  Seriously!</li>
</ol>
<p />
So there you have it.  Lots of stuff to get excited about while you impatiently wait for EB to get over here all over again.  And if you're still bored, hey, I dunno, go play another round of Tetris or something.
<p />

I have a new petition idea... What if we have them localize just a few copies, and mail them to everyone who singed the petition? Everyone will include their emial addresses, and then Nintendo could email everyone for their addresses, and then they'd mail everyone their Mother 3... They could charge all of our credit cards for whatever they would cost, and they wouldn't lost any money, because they wouldn't mass produce them! Imagine how much someone could make on that on eBay... Of course, you'd have to be an idiot to sell it on eBay...

That sounds more like a hardcore-fan promotional stunt than a bona fide way to get the game out - why would they only send the game to us when they could market it to an entire continent? - but I like the way you think; I'd totally sell my address and/or soul to Nintendo for an EB demo disc.  Undoubtedly, part of the reason the big N still hasn't dropped the release date on any EB games is because they're whipping up the best darn ad campaign ever.  It'll have to be pretty awesome if they want to reverse the bad karma on their old ads.  You remember: "This Game Stinks."  Brilliant!  :rolleyes:

You know, Earthbound is a very special game like no other, and so was its predecessor. They were the only ones to break the mold and give us a funny, original RPG. To experience that feeling again, to play Earthbound again for the first time, would be pure awesome. Mother 3 is coming, and that oppurtunity looms in the distance. Waiting for it is like waiting for EB No Matsuri. You know when you were little, and you couldn't sleep (or maybe it was just me) because you knew the Annual Gift Man would deliver either life or death? Man, those were good times. I wonder, though, if Mother 3 can beat the awesomeness of Earthbound. Earthbound succeeded in defeating Mother by a hair. (Maybe more in other people's opinions) Can Mother 3 be BETTER than EarthBound? All this time we've spent talking and playing this game, we've been bonding with it, loving it and choosing it as our favorite game above no other. (except for the people who like Chrono Trigger better, which actually does have better battles and such, but doesn't have the same endearing text/plot.) Can Mother 3 POSSIBLY be BETTER than Earthbound? If so, what's going to be in it?
<p />
Who will be the new Mr. Saturn?<br />
The new bad guy?<br />
The new main character?<br />
Will the battles have timed hits? :D<br />
Will the final battle live up to the expectations of the last two games?<br />
Will the fun of the battles be better than Chrono Trigger?<br />
How much is this going to cost?<br />
Where's my burrito?
<p />
I sincerely wish for one thing when it comes out: Someone makes a text file of the text. Or I spontaneously learn Japanese.
<p />
Hey, I just thought of a great system for that! There'll be this page with a map of wherever you are in the game (with sprites!) and if you click on the sprite a window will pop up with the translation! Hooray!
<p />
Anyway, Mother 3 brings up more things than one can possibly imagine. Will the guy who's running it now still do the Mother 3 section? Will he do a good job? Will it be like the old days? There'll be a wave of stuff undone for the Mother 3 section, and everyone will be submitting so much stuff to it. Man, things will be awesome. Also, I'm wondering... what will happen if people arrive who've played Mother 3 and not Earthbound? It's a small chance, but it may happen. Confusion will ensue.
<p />
PS: SimonBob, you are my hero. Why don't you appear on #eb? (I saw you once in another channel. Apparently you're allergic or something.)
<p />
PPS: Please get a cool co-editor for Mailbag this time, whether it be Tomato, Reidman, Pappycat, or even myself.
<p />
PPPS: Seriously consider having me as a co-editor.
<p />
PPPPS: I had a dream I wrote this letter and then you said "Congratulations! You've written a letter of the month!"
<p />
PPPPPS: Please update this weekly again. Good times, good times.
<p />
PPPPPPS: Bring back "Kick it with a tasty groove."
<p />
PPPPPPPS: Hey, I was looking through the mailbag and I realized "Hey, waitaminnit, Simon's Soapbox is gone!" Why is it gone? Will it ever be back? Will there be a Grand ReOpening sale? Personally, I think a better name would be "Simon's Spiel." I can only hope for it's triumphant return.

I'm pretty sure Mr. Saturn is in Mother 3, unless Itoi took him out again.  The new bad guys may or may not be angry pigs.  I sure hope they kept Flint, because he looked awesome.
<p />
Skulryk runs the Mother 3 section, and by "runs" I mean "ignores, in favour of putting out fires on the forums all day and night."  If Mother 3 comes out, I suspect we can just run it by posting links to the forums - everyone's gonna be playing, discussing, and playing some more.  Although some of us with weaknesses to spoilers might actually take a vacation.  I've been playing GTA:SA lately, I haven't looked at a FAQ yet, and it's tearing me apart a little bit.  If M3 came out I'd probably unplug myself from the LAN.
<p />
For the postscripts: I quit #eb due to personal politics that I won't bore you with here.  I only get co-responders when I'm on time, which lately seems to be never, but I'll keep you in mind.  Congratulations! You've written a letter of the month!  I guess dreams <i>can</i> come true.  "Kick it with a tasty groove" was really Falcon's thing, and the Soapbox was just a concession to Mike's thing; I'd feel bad about using them without those guys around.  Maybe if they coreply someday.

Dear Mailbaggers,
<p />
I'm going off topic because a reformed blonde is making me so... 
<p />
*Ahem*
<p />
If Mr.Saturns have no legs why do they have ladders? If Mr.Saturn all wear bows ,are they are chicks? And are they from Saturn? TELL ME before I kill myself. Also if Ness was a tree what kind would he be?
<p />
I felt curious today please kill my curisoty. Thanks.

A little closed-minded, aren't we?  You can totally climb a ladder with two feet.  They could be angled, like stepladders.  The angle could be really sharp since Mr. Saturns are really short.  You can also make guys wear ribbons; whether they <i>want</i> to or not is up to discussion.  Maybe all the Mr. Saturns are victims of their sisters' sleepovers, and that's why they moved away from Saturn.  Ness would probably be one of those trees that doesn't randomly explode.  I don't know what you'd call that, they don't seem to have a name for it in Eagleland.

if what Miyamoto said was true, then we know at least Japan will be getting Mother 3, and even if we dont, our good friends over at Neo-Demiforce can hack it up for us. If it isnt released stateside, we should most definetely send another petition out, heck, we might even get some recognition in the ending credits.

hey...I love the fact that this is on the Nintendo forums..It is currently goting strong 500+ replys of Earthbound goodness! So far it has survived 6 days without going too far under the forums or getting locked or deleated. Now I don't know if this GETS them to release Mother 1+2 (Earthbound 0+1)over here or not. I mean with all the demand that was shown in the past. I say theres a chance,but I'm not going to hold my breath at all. However heres hoping for this to open up there eyes.

Yeah, that topic got more attention faster than a mosquito on a princess. I'm really glad that NOA is finally (dear God, finally) taking notice to us, and I think it will only get better.
<p />
Besides, if a 400+ page petition can't get attention, what can? We would only get more attention if we went up to NOA and held them hostage in the name of Mother, and that doesn't seem like the best idea at the time.
<p />
Next petition let's get on C-Span. ;D

Do you really promise to update on time? I dunno, I never promise much on the way of the Location Project. Which is fine since only a few people really pay a whole lot of attention to it, but maybe thats because I don't make a big production out of the whole thing, for the most part. 
<p />
Its all good, since most people are pretty familiar with where they are. Except me, as I often play the popular game of "Where did I park my car?" even in some really small parking lots. Honestly its kind of odd that I work with GIS since I seem to be inherently confused when it comes to direction, one time when I was visiting my brother we went to Fry's Electronics and ended up returning 3 times trying to leave. I can manage day to day, naturally, but when it comes to leaving the beaten path, I'm a few grades above hopeless.
<p />
To be more on topic, I'm glad there has been discussion on the Nintendo forums, I just hope NOA isn't yanking us (me) around just to stir interest in Nintendo merchandise. Which would be pretty low, so I hope that isn't the case.
<p />
Anyhow I think thats about enough out of me to last a good week, if not month (har har), have a nice weekend, Simon.

I've been visiting nintendo.com more in the last month than I did in 2004, and I still haven't felt like buying more products than I already have.  Unless you count StarFox: Armada.  But that's because I'm a sucker for that series.  (I can already hear my detractors snickering.)

I think that EB should either be remade, or given a sequel.  At the end of EB, Pokey send you that letter.  I have been waiting a very long time to see what Ness does about the letter.  Wouldn't it be cool to have Ness, Paula, Jeff, and Poo come back together and defeat a new cosmic nemisis?
<p />
Maybe they should embellish on Ness and Paula's relationship.  It was rather abrupt when you beat the game and suddenly learn that Ness and Paula are going out from her dad.

That would actually be cool, but on the flip side, I'm really intrigued by this Flint guy.  Maybe Mother 3 is both a continuation and a whole new story at the same time?  Also, maybe Ness and Paula should be older before they start thinking about hooking up.  Maybe that!

It may be coming....but to America?  Remember that Earthbound BOMBED here in the states.  I'd LOVE to see a new Earthbound, but I'm also still waiting on the promised GBA releases as well.
<p />
Maybe a petition isn't the answer.  Tell Nintendo of America we will put our money where our mouth is and pre-order the game if they release it here.  It would be hard to implement but I think it's the only way to convince NOA to bring Earthbound back to the states.

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center>
<p />
Well, of <i>course</i> we'd pre-order EarthBound, in loud voices, so as to encourage the other customers to follow our example.  And then when we got the game we'd hold aloft our plastic bags and shout, "I've got EarthBound!  You should get it too!"  Then it's a simple matter of outrunning mall security, going home, and enjoying our new games.

Sooooo, some guy from NOA is posting on your forums eh? I seem to recall a site called Rare-Extreme meeting a similar situation in the form of the head of the Team making Conker: Live and Reloaded posting on THEIR forums. There was some speculation on whether he was authentic or not. 
<p />
I'd be careful if I were you, this guy could be a con artist. Of course, I'm not saying he is, I just have a strange feeling that nothing we say towards this guy will end up being acknowledged in the end. But hey, feel free to laugh your butt off at how wrong I am in the end if you want.

Sooooo, this is what happens when you don't read carefully enough and fire off a letter in the direction you think it'll do the most damage.  Some guy from NOA <i>named NOA_Rufus</i> posted on <i>his own</i> forum.  Feel free to lower your face embarrasedly and mutter, "never mind."

Good thing that it is coming!

Earthbound came out in 1995, and now it's 2005. And for those that are not good at math, that's a 10 year difference! 10 years! Metroid only got a 8 year difference between Super Metriod and Metroid Fusion/Prime! And do we honestly know anyone that was waiting for that series? Darn Nintendo.....

Now that it's coming out we can all break out the adult drinks and run right to the nearest store.

How scary would it be if Nintendo had actually been planning this 10-year reunion since 2002, but didn't want to tell us for fear of angry reprisals from our insane cult-like fanbase?  Maybe there's a top-secret "need to know" file on EB in the back drawers of Nintendo's darkest basement offices!  Woo conspiracy.

Hi. I'm here to tell you i've never seen such a committed team for a video game and i'm quite impressed. However, don't you think that site meetings and online protests are a bit too much. I think that for as long as you may have tried, theres no way they're ever going to listen. They're so wrapped up in games like "Final Fantasy" and "Grand theft auto" they're just going to pass it up. I suggest you try to convince a different company to buy the rights. You never know what luck you'll have. until next time...

Well, since Square makes FF and Rockstar makes GTA, you'd think Nintendo and HAL wouldn't be too busy to put out a little EB magic for us.  But maybe they're just wrapped up in another wacky Kirby game.  Oh, how I loathe that pink puffy marshmallow and his time-stealing ways!  If it weren't for his myriad of transformations, maybe Mother 3 would be out by now!  Grr.
