Lots of weirdness this week. But people mainly wrote in concerning the content of the <A HREF="http://walkthrough.starmen.net/mother3/">Mother 3 Walkthrough</A>. So check out the letters and make sure to write in for next week. <P /> <b>Next Week's Topic:</b> <BR /> We all want Mother 3 to come to America. So mail in your thoughts of how you think Nintendo should market the game in North America.

As of right now, I just want to say that the Mother 3 guide needs some serious additions. ESPECIALLY the enemies list. I want to see more of these nutcase monsters running around. Also, I think there's a lack of weapons in there as well. Let's get some more info in there! I'm almost done with Chapter 4 and I aint going any further without some boss info! <P /> Oh and here's your wii joke: I hate Nintendo, You hate Nintendo, Wii all hate Nintendo*. <P /> *= denotes that wii really just hate the people at Nintendo responsible for saying they have no plans for Mother 3 when they should be MAKING plans for Mother 3. Wii don't really hate Nintendo as a whole. Or do wii? <P /> - Lordofthesuplex <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> I personally haven't looked much at the Mother 3 walkthrough as I don't want to be spoiled. But if you haven't already, you may find <A HREF="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=msg&th=22820">Tomato's Quick Walkthrough</A> to be useful. <p /> - EBounding

If M3 was at E3 it would have been surefire that M3 was coming here. It was a painful blow to the community when E3 did not have Mother 3 at it. We can retaliate with UberProject5001 when it is ready. <P /> - Revival of Buzz Buzz <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> None of our "operations" have been in the spirit of "attacking" Nintendo, but I know for sure that the UberProject isn't going to be like the other activities (like the petitions, letter writing campaigns, etc.). <p /> - EBounding

I really like how the basic Mother 3 overview doesn't reveal storyline spoilers at all, so it's very nice. <P/> However, with the enemy list of the Mother 3 section, I dislike them in alphabetical order when viewing them by chapter. I prefer in the order the enemies appear, for minimal spoilers. <P/> - lewahi <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> The Mother 3 guide should eventually take the shape of the EarthBound guide where the enemies in each "section" are listed at the bottom. <p /> - EBounding

Hi Ebounding! <P /> I mailed this to Simon Bob, but it looks like he isn't doing it anymore so I will ask you the question that was meant for him. <P /> What are YOU going to do to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Pokemon? I know I am going to get drunk and play Pokemon Snap for like 5 hours, but what are you going to do? <P /> Kind regards and a happy llama! <P /> -Geekboy20X6 <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> Is Pokemon really that old? Well, just for the anniversary, I think I'll gut a Pikachu and wear it as a hat. <p /> That's all for this week! <p /> - EBounding
