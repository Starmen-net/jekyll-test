Mailbag VI. Almost at "Adrian's Revenge". After the lackluster week prior, how will this week fare? It's up to you guys!<P />

<B>This Week's Topic:</B>
<br />
America recently celebrated Thanksgiving. Canada, not so much. Regardless, let's do a Thanksgiving theme. As mailbaggers, we are all sitting around the supper table giving thanks. What do you say? What are you thankful for? It must be EB-related.

<div align="center">Dr. Baconman says:</div><P />

Let us give our thanks for all that we have been blessed with:<P />

We are thankful, Lord, for the delicious food specialty of Trout Yogurt and Beef Jerky Bananas.<P />

We are thankful for those loving friends who accompanied us into the world(HI CARP!).<font color="red">[Editor:  Hi Bacon!]</font><P />

We are thankful that Flint un-retired to pull out his stops yet.<P />

And WII are especially thankful for old man Itoi* promising us a new Earthbound game by the next decade.<P />

*-Might actually be Liar Dan, Jr.<P />

<div align="center">Carparama responds:</div><P />

Even if Itoi doesn't come through with that statement, assuming he actually made the statement, it won't bother me.  Mother 3 will be enough, especially after it is translated.<P />

Beef jerky bananas?  That sounds a lot better than it probably is.  But the Flint comment?  Who is Flint?  IS THAT A MOTHER 3 SPOILERS, BACONMAN?!  Oh, you're lucky you're awesome.<P />

And in this reply, I'll let something be known.  Every letter received by mailbag today will be co-responded by several of my friends.  For DrBaconman, I thought it'd be wise to let my good buddy Mansion_Maniac respond to Baconman's.  :)<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Mansion_Maniac responds:</div><P />

I dunno where this SICK, SICK love you have for Beef Jerky Bananas comes from whilst completely lacking acknowledgement for Peanut Cheese Bars!  If Itoi had a time machine back in the early 90s and saw that statement, he would be so devastated that he would cancel plans on EarthBound!  You hear that, Bacon?  YOU would be responsible for a world without EarthBound, and thusly, a world without Starmen.net, without the Radio PSI you so lovingly listen to!  Instead, this "Flint" guy you speak of would probably instead give him the inspiration to make him the main character for a cowboy platformer game where you have to collect stars, use lassos to bind and kill enemies, and fight galactic superheroes... wait a minute, I just basically described the Toy Story game.<P />

...I've lost my train of thought, disregard everything I said.<P />

<div align="center">LordJimmy says:</div><P />

I am thankful for EarthBound<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Carparama responds:</div><P />

... Why?<P />

I am thankful for those who submit to mailbag, but ... this is the last letter I post of this type.  You have to put a little effort in.  Even just a tad.  You're lucky I like you, Lord of Jimmies.  :)<P />

For this co-response, I'm going to have Gonmon take a break from radio to say something.<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Gonmon responds:</div><P />

Well, I guess I'm thankful for all the artwork that I always see on the site, as well as all the support that Radio PSI has been getting. All the listeners are great!<P />

I'm also thankful for LordJimmy being thankful for Earthbound, because at least someone has to be.<P />

<div align="center">Ranger says:</div><P />

I had my turkey like a month ago. Yum.<P />

Umm...I'd say I'm most thankful for the Earthbound Tile Editor. That thing is so useful for anything it's not even funny.<P />

Seriously. Just a press of the Prt Scrn button and BOOM! Any non-sprite graphics you want. So fun.<P />

Whoever made that thing (I think it was Tomato)I thank them 1000 times and give them the Ranger's Love.<P />

That or the Moonside palette. INSTANT RAVE PARTY!<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Carparama responds:</div><P />

I'll tell you one thing.  I absolutely love PK Hack.  It's such a great tool.  One of these days, I will make a whole hack.  And it will be awesome.  Everyone will praise me and such.<P />

Ranger, are you aware of #pkhax on DynastyNet?  If you use mIRC, you can chat with other PKHackers as well.  I haven't active in the channel lately, so I haven't seen if you've been there.  Anyway, I have Mr. Accident here to respond to your letter.  This man is a legend, yo!<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Mr. Accident responds:</div><P />

Hi Ranger!<P />

Actually, it was cabbage who made the original tile editor; it's his hard work we have to thank for our current ability to modify all sorts of compressed graphics in EarthBound. It's kinda hard to find him most of the time, but I'm sure he appreciates your gratitude. And I think I can say on behalf of the entire community that this is exactly the sort of thing we like to hear; it's always great to know people out there are actually using this crap. :D<P />

Anyway, I'm glad you enjoy using PK Hack tools; you should definitely continue using them a lot, because we certainly haven't installed any sleeper mind control devices in them or anything. I recommend taking them with you when you shower, for example. Just remember to always ACTIVATE DELTA SEQUENCE NINE YELLOW. Er, I mean, you saw nothing. Nothing at all.<P />

- Mr. A<P />

P.S: TERMINATE SUBJECT.<P />

Ah, that's fine.  You're a loyal mailbag submitter, yo!  I love photographic geniuses, myself.  I wonder if I could take some pictures for the funfest.  Yes ... that's what I'll do.

Oh, and because of the language in your post, I'll let resident #earthbound owner Coreyback help me out with this letter.  (Oh, and this is the last time "donkey" will be allowed in a letter.  It has been abused a lot lately.)

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Coreyback responds:</div><P />

I love photography myself! My beauty will be preserved for the ages. I'd be glad to show you some of my work sometime, some of it is really excellent.<P />

Oh, and...<P />

<div align="center">Ninten1 says:</div><P />

At the moment, I am most thankful for Mother 3. I have a deluxe box sitting on the table besides me, begging to be opened. I don't have the heart to tell it that it will have to wait until Christmas.<P />

I've waited a long time for this game, and I'm finally going to play it. I feel like a part of me will finally be complete. I'm thankful for that and all of the positive influence the Mother series has brought to my life.<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Carparama responds:</div><P />
Ahh, you have a will of steel, with enough patience to go with it. I wish I was in your boots. I'm holding out for a translation, myself, and it doesn't help that anticipating something drives me nuts. (See the Wii, for example.) But... all you can do is wait... and hope... or take a class in Japanese, but that sounds silly. ...Right?<P />

I'm in the same boat.  Or, I will be once it is translated.  Oh boy, I cannot wait.<P />

Are you actually waiting until Christmas to open it?  That is so cool.  I don't know if I would have the same willpower.<P />

Anyway, Ninten1, you've always been one of those people on the forums who I thought was cool.  I figured I'd have another person in the same category respond to this letter.  Here is SuperSpeedy.<P />

<div align="center">nekoaitsu says:</div><P />

I'm thankful for the recently announced fan translation of Mother 3.<P />

This gives me the feeling that you get when you put some delisauce from a jar on rock candy.<P />

mmm...... (Less than three sign; edited by Carparama)<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Carparama responds:</div><P />

My lawyers will be contacting you regarding the temporary death of mailbag.  Your "less than threes" decimated it.<P />

I tried eating rock candy once.  It hurt my teeth.  Bad.<P />

Now, for a serious comment, I am just as psyched for this translation.  SO PSYCHED.  I have heard a few spoily things just to make waiting worthwhile.  And no offense to those other guys, but knowing we have Tomato on this translation makes me think the quality will be wonderful.<P />

Oh, and because you use those heart "symbol" things, and the fact I think you're name is Japanese, I thought Luna would be a good one to respond here.  She eats pocky.  That's Japanese, isn't it?

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Luna responds:</div><P />

Always remember, kids. When writing a less than three, it's important to type the "&lt;" as "& l  t ;",(without the spaces) as not to break anything. By the way, you do realise that deli sauce is mayo, right? Is it the new fad to eat mayo on sugar? Is this the new peanut cheese bars? You people disgust me.<P />

<div align="center">Zip Code Ness says:</div><P />

I'm thankful for the Earthbound holy scriptures.<P />

"But of the Orange tree's of invention and machines, you can not invest in it, for in the day that you invest in it, all its inventions shall surely break." - Twoson 2:17<P />

"And the exit mouse said: am I my brother's keeper?" - Twoson 4:9<P />

"The telephone so loved the world, he gave his only begotton son (Ness) so that the world may not perish from Gigyas but have the best videogame ever." - Buzz Buzz 3:16<P />

"Brickman says: I'm the brick, the road, and the dungeon, no one comes to the Submarine, except through me." - Buzz Buzz 14:6<P />

Trust me, I'm not sacreligious.<P />

"And on that fifth day, Carparama asked for a sandwich.  The sandwich he received was top of the line.  Pickles, cheese on top of the bread ..." -Carparama 3:12<P />

Oh, wow.  That'd be so awesome.  If it didn't offend so many people, somebody could totally make an EarthBound bible.  Anyway, here is xod aka sarencele with a response.<P />

<div align="center">PoeTrader says:</div><P />

First and foremost, I am thankful for Giygas. Without him and the chaos that he created, we would not have a reason to buy baseball bats, frying pans, and bubble gum.<P />

I am thankful for the eight sanctuary bosses. They are the ones that made me train hard to become stronger.<P />

I am thankful for my dad for always keeping a record of my progress and checking up on me when I was out too long.<P />

I am thankful for my sister for taking care of the stuff that I no longer needed, but still wanted to hold on to.<P />

I am thankful for my three best friends. Without them, I wouldn't have gotten very far and I'd still be stuck in Twoson.<P />

Last, but not least, I am thankful for Criminal Caterpillars and Master Criminal Worms. Without them, my quest would have been a whole lot harder.<P />

I would like to end with a doodle that I drew last year on Thanksgiving:<P />

<img src="http - //poe.fobby.net/doodles/saturnthanks.jpg" /><P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Carparama responds:</div><P />

Poe, you are absolutely grand.  That drawing is fantastic.  I love doodles.  :)<P />

As for the Caterpillars, were you always so mean?  They are living creatures just like you and I.  And you use them to build ... LEVELS?!  Wow, so cruel.<P />

Anyway, I decided to have another fanart person named ozwalled help me respond to this one.  He's a RadioPSI DJ on Sundays along with being 'fanart man'.  Isn't he our webmaster?<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">ozwalled responds:</div><P />

Giygas -- good one! I never really thought of it that way. Can't have good without the evil and all that jazz. To evil!<P />

The rest of these are all great things to be thankful for, too. Where, after all, would we be without crime, people to beat the crap out of us, and family? Not saving the world, that's fer' sure!<P />

And how can one possibly argue with a drawing, EPECIALLY one that includes a caption about barfy smells? No one, I say. No one.<P />

<div align="center">Apple Kid says:</div><P />

Wow, it's been a very, very long time since last I graced this establishment.<P />

Firstly, yes, I'm that same unoriginally-named individual from some period I'm guesstimating as roughly four years ago. (To be as exact as possible, from here: http://classic.starmen.net/mailbag/narchive/narchive37.php, to here: http://classic.starmen.net/mailbag/narchive/narchive61.php, whatever those dates may be.) Anywho, I really have no intention of even touching on the topic at hand, so please excuse my ramblings.<P />

Anywho, so I was bored, and, not having anything else to do at midnight, I decided to revisit some memories of yore, and stumbled across my old, brief outing with the mailbag. And, to be frank, I learned that I was completely out of line back then. As such, I decided an apology was in order.<P />

I'm not sure if any of these people are still around, but Falcon24, SimonBob, MikeTheEBGuru, and anyone else who had the misfortune of mailbag duty during my little escapade, allow me to apologize for my behavior way back when. I can only imagine how--for lack of a more suitable word coming to mind--irritating it must have been to respond to my blatantly idiotic ramblings at the time. It's people like you, who are willing to put up with those sorts of misguided individuals, that make fansites and communities like this possible.<P />

But, I'm rambling at this point, so I'd might as well wrap this up:  happy holidays, Starmen.net Staff, Earthbound Community, and I wish you all the best.<P />

<center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center><P />

<div align="center">Carparama responds:</div><P />

Where to start?<P />

First of all, on behalf of Falcon, Simon, Mikey and whoever else you may have submitted to, I accept the apology.<P />

Well, hey.  This month has been weird for some of us here at Starmen.Net.  We've had some people like rmsharpe, natechan, PkErthbnd and others return to the site for the first time in years, and it's been a very good thing.  Since it sounds as if you have grown up, welcome back.  Hopefully this won't be the last time we hear from you.  Not just mailbag, either.  Forums and maybe IRC?<P />

Anyway, I added you to MSN as well.  Keep in touch.<P />

Carparama summarizes:<P />

Don't hate me!  Yikes, I know it has been two weeks.  This time of the year is rough as I have final exams.  University exams.  Now, if they were all Physical Education ones, I'd be fine.  But since they are actual subjects, they're tougher.  With one to go, I managed the time to get this update done.<P />

Special thanks to everyone who co-responded on such short notice.  Very much appreciated.<P />

Oh, and Apple Kid, appreciate you being the man.  I'm sure Falc/Mike/Simon will too when they read it.  Just an example, folks.  Even if you screw up in the past, you can make up for it.<P />
