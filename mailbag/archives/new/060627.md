This week we got a lot of letters about EarthBound strategies. Do you use any of them? I also finally posted a Rescue Reidman letter so check that out. <P /> <b>Next Week's Topic:</b> <BR /> Well I finished Mother 3, so now it's time to have spoiler filled thoughts on the game. So if you finished the game, what did you think? Was it worth the wait? What did you like and what dissapointed you? The topic's wide open, so I expect lots of letters!

I took a really really conservative approach to Earthbound last summer; I figured my dad was a crook and a 13 year old shouldn't be paying through the nose for a Yo-Yo. So, I took what I was given (like a Cracked Bat or a Broken Antenna here and there) and decided that it would probably be best if I treasured those objects with some kind of sentimental value, rather than shoulder them out for some high-street 'Made-in-the-Phillipines-with-pride' trash. So, I only ever used Cracked Bat, until I won myself a Gutsy, bare fists until I got a Sword, I dunno about Paula, and Jeff got broken hand-me downs. I also decided to never use items, and went on a burger detox, only using my mind to heal me, which is quite a hippy thing to do, making Ness somewhat conflicted. Next time, I think I'll make it my ambition to always have $0 or something, to contrast my prudent tactics last year. Is there going to be another one, even? <p /> - Hawien Shertz <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> Yeah....alls been quiet lately with EBFGP.

I always notice that through the game, I rely on my PSI to heal moreso than food items. This usually ends up being a moot strategy, however, as I ALWAYS end up stockpiling brain food lunches and horns of life! The result? I go to fight Gygas, EVERY TIME with too many items. <p /> I always end the game thinking, "boy howdy, I really don't need to waste so much money on all these things...and I really need help...my mind just thought 'boy howdy'...odd". <p /> One thing I've also realized is the importance of fighting as many battles as possible in Twoson. The reason? I don't know why this always happens, but whenever I get to Threed, I'm out of money and I often find myself struggling to establish a bankroll. I can barely keep my two buddies alive long enough to fight some pumpkins and puppets. <p /> I wonder if others are as, ehem, meticulous (anal) as I am concerning the strongest items. I know some people can wait and play through past a few areas before they need the latest bracelet, bat, or bazooka (What? Alliteration is funnnn). I find myself not able to continue the game until I know my team is as stacked as possible with all the latest gear and gizmos to ensure swift victory in battle. Yeh. <p /> Moot is a cool word, <p /> -Arad <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> For years I would also always stockpile my items. I need to break the habit. <p /> - EBounding

Well, I always use the typical RPG rules, as well as some exclusive to EB. <p /> 1. Save early and often <p /> 2. Lvl up = good <p /> 3. Use PSI conservatively on regular enemies, liberally on bosses/Starmen <p /> 4. PSI Heal and PSI Lifeup > Recovery items <p /> 5. 1/128 items are well worth the hunt <p /> 6. Use as little PSI as needed against Carbon Dog. If you use all your PSI before fighting Diamond Dog, you're going to get your head handed to you. <p /> 7. Stock up on supplies in Magicant <p /> 8. Multi Bottle Rockets are your friends <p /> 9. Say 'Fuzzy Pickles'! <p /> Roland 0f Gilead

Quite simply, I just try to level up as much as possible. Someone as hardcore as SimonBob may like going after Frank with a backpack full of Hamburgers at level 3 or 4, but me? Nah, I can't do that business. <p /> I play it safe the whole way through. I mean, I usually don't even fight a Shark till I'm a good level 6 or 7, and even then, I just fight Sharks till I'm level 8 or 9, and THEN I go after Frank. By the time I'm out of Onett, I may very well be up to level 18 or 19, because I spend MORE time levelling up at the caves, and then, well, the fuzz usually gives up a hearty amount of EXP by the time you've beaten them. <p /> PSI? Only when absolutely necessary, mainly boss battles. Stocking up on certain items? Complete waste of backpack space, I like my backpack relatively empty, anyways. Low levels? Well, I think I've been over that already. <p /> Besides, when you're in as many battles as me to raise all those levels, you get tons more moolah then you would on your hardcore low-level speedruns. By the time I'm out of Onett, don't you think I'd have enough money to buy and sell 10 different Cheap Bracelets? <p /> Watch out EBounding, with the money I make, I can buy and sell you, too! <p /> - Mansion Maniac <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> I try to be eXtreme and avoid leveling but that can get me strapped for cash. Thank goodness you can have chicken farms in your backpack. <p /> - EBounding

I usually just bash everything until it dies, with Ness being my powerhouse. The only one that I really go all out with when it comes to PSI is Paula, because PSI Freeze is really useable. Jeff typically attacks, sometimes I let him use bottle rockets. Poo is usually a sitting duck, at least until I get the Sword of Kings, so he usually just uses whatever PSI he has. I don't really conserve PP with him. <p /> PSI Caramels are my best friend though. Whenever I find one of them and there isn't already one in reserves, I'll totally use all the PSI I can, for some reason. <p /> - askthemaster <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> Having a turbo controller and auto fight is probably the fastest way to finish most battles, in my opinion. <p /> - EBounding

I usually never pack healing items unless I need them for something like the Monkey Caves. I depend on my PSI for healing and attacking, so I'm always using the Magic Truffle trick and extra PSI Caramels and those Magic Butterflies. <p /> (But I always end up using Bottle Rockets anyways ;)) <p /> - Angela <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> I'd give a better response, but I'm reeling from my choice of a title for this letter. <p /> - EBounding

I hereby declare that Rescue Reidman 3 will be the 2nd or 3rd greatest game ever. Behind Earthbound and Mother 3. Maybe. <p /> And hey, is it too late to start begging for cameo spots in RR3? Because, you see, there's this squad of Ninja Robot Assassins after me, and I heard from Old Man Q that the only way to defeat them would be to appear in a Rescue Reidman game. <p /> Hoping that I don't get murdered, <p /> -Dr. Baconman <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> What is the deal with this game? The following is an investigative interview report scoop exclusive with the rescued reidman: <p /> EBounding: does the "Rescue reidman" game disturb you in anyway?<BR /> reidman: i love being rescued<BR /> reidman: puts me in my place<BR /> EBounding: i can <I>totally</I> relate!<BR /> reidman: yeah, getting stuck in that well must have been pretty humiliating<BR /> <p /> <I>CASE CLOSED...?</I> <p /> Tune in next week!
