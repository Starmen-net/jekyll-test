This week we have talk on this year's <A HREF="/ebfgp/">EBFGP</A> and some more thoughts and questions about Mother 3 in North America. Check 'em out! <P /> <b>Next Week's Topic:</b> <BR /> What type of strategies do you use when playing EarthBound? For example I tend to conserve my PSI as much as possible as well as my items. Do you spend a lot of PSI? Do you always buy and pack a lot of items? Talk about all your favorite strategies or anything else for next time.

Hey, I'm a big fan of the Mother/EarthBound series and I'm wondering if all the American/European (I'm from England, don't think we haven't heard of this awsome series!) fans out there, has Nintendo even noticed and even slightly considered at least giving us another Mother title sometime in the future? I'd love to play it on the Wii or DS personally. <P /> Yours faithfully, <P /> Sean Kerswill <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> Well the good news is that Nintendo is <I>well aware</I> of our strong passion for the Mother series. So mission accomplished there. The bad news is we're not sure if they're convinced that it would be interesting to the general "gaming public". If they are, they're being extremely tight lipped about it. <p /> So all we can really do is wait it out. <p /> -EBounding

There needs to be a winter version of the EBFGP that focuses on EarthBound Zero, in addition to EBFGP. That way, we can focus on both games throughout the year. You can use a different staffer to host it, to keep the workload off of JamesPicard, and I'm sure there could be enough interest built up to test the waters and do it THIS year. <P /> - Mansion Maniac <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> Yeah I agree that it's high time we have one that features EB Zero. <P /> -EBounding

The EBFGP is an event I've been into since I started checking out the site, around 1972, after the Great War. <P /> I don't think it should be changed at all. It's always been the same classic event, and that correlates to EB. It hasn't changed in the 10 odd years we've all been playing it, and as our favorite or one of our favorite games, it doesn't lose it's luster. <P /> As a matter of fact, especially being older and busier nowadays, I find myself more into the game than ever when I spend an entire year talking about it on the forums, and now, in the summer, I have a chance to relive the game I love by keeping up with the updates and playing through, taking (usually just a few) challenges on the way. <P /> It really is about getting back into the game. <P /> - Arad

I definitely think it'd be awesome to have Anthadd contribute some special quite difficult trivia to each EBFGP day, so that even experianced players can have something obscure to look for. I would elaborate, but the dishes are yelling for me in a voice strangely like that of my father.... <P /> - The2ndLlama <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> Hey, that's a great idea! Hopefully it can be implemented. And don't get the dishes mad. <p /> -EBounding

A lot of people seem to be forgetting that Nintendo, if they do choose to release this game in North America, will probably do so via the Virtual Console on Wii. It would make the most sense from a cost standpoint. As much as it pains me to say it, I just don't see them releasing any more noteworthy games for the GBA...but then again who knows. <P /> - Kojiro

You know what game sucks? Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure for the Nintendo Gamecube, this piece of junk that I had the misfortune of playing a few years ago still haunts me to this very day. This game is horrible. <P /> Anyway I hope everything with EBFGP goes alright. And remember, don't buy or play crappy video games. <P /> - Shatterstar <p /> <center><img src="/mailbag/mbbar.gif" /></center> <p /> They made a video game, about a theme park? What we really need are more games like Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball. <p /> That's all for this week! <p /> - EBounding
