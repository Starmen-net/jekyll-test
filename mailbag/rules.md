If you want your mailbag letter to be posted, simply don't be an idiot.  Swearing and other abusive language will not get your letter posted on the site.<br />
<br />
While not every letter can be selected, you can increase your chances of it getting posted by sending a thoughtful response for the current week's topic. Asking an uncommon question concerning the site or any of the EarthBound games is another good way to get your letter posted (questions are good!).  Any other comments concerning the game or the site are also welcomed.  Also make sure to keep it somewhat short.  If it gets too long, you might as well submit an <A HREF="/articles/">article</A>!<br />
<br />
Longer letters may be trimmed down, but the gist of your message will always be obvious.<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions, PM the section maintainer: <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=usrinfo&id=133">Carparama</a><br />
