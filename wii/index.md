With the release of the Wii and its Virtual Console, EarthBound fans instantly saw the potential for MOTHER games finally coming stateside. Alas, there's nothing yet, but there's always hope. In the meantime, Starmen.Net is expanding its awesomeness into the Wii realm in the hopes of creating a solid Wii community of MOTHER fans. Below is what Wii are Starmen is all about:
