When I took this position up, one of my main concerns to help the Flukes section was to purge the gallery of newer and older submissions alike, that were full of crap that goes against what the idea of what a fluke should be, and especially goes against the new <a href="http://starmen.net/flukes/guidelines.php">Guidelines</a> being set for the section.  Starting August, the purging will begin, but to save myself some time, you can sign up to be a Flukes watchdog, and when it's time to purge any flukes based on what goes against a certain Guideline (only one at a time, to keep it organized), you can help me go through them and see which ones have to go.  Maybe this way, we can finally cleanse the Flukes section and help it get out of the Hole Of Stupidity it's dug itself in.

To sign up to be a Flukes watchdog, e-mail me at MansionManiac[AT]GMail[DOT]com with the subject line "MAKE ME A WATCHDOG!" and give me a few darn good reasons why I should have you aboard the Watchdog Express.
