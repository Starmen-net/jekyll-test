Welcome to Fan Music, and I'm looking forward to music that people send in! 

If you're new to the site, and wonder why you can't submit your Fan Music, it's because you need to <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=register">register on Starmen.net's FUD forum.</a> You have to hand it to our site development team; the site is intergrated with our forums, and it makes navigating easier for you and the staffers.

Audio Fan Music has a couple of guidelines that need to be followed. Any submissions not following these guidelines will not be accepted.
<p />
<ul>
<li />Only the following audio file formats will be accepted: <b>.mp3, .ogg, .aac</b>
<p />
<li />Audio file bitrates cannot exceed 320kbps, although <b>192kbps and under is highly suggested.</b>
<p />
<li />Ripping other artists MIDI file tabulation, <b>will not be tolerated.</b>
<p />  
<li />You cannot sample, and remix other artists music: unless you have <b>permission from the artist.</b> For more information: Contact <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=usrinfo&id=257">Erik</a>.
<p />
<li />Do not submit Fan Music containing offensive material; EarthBound is an rated E game, therefore the Fan Music will also be like that. 
</ul>
