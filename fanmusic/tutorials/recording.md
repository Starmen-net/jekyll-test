Digital music production, has really changed how musicians, both professional and ameatur, record music. It's flexable, and some applications, like Apple's Garageband, have really brought a professional sounding, but easy to use for the home user. 

However, most people at home don't understand how to record stuff right, and end up using a microphone, which is a poor way to record electric instruments, like an electric guitar, bass, or a non-USB piano/keyboards. 

In this tutorial, I'll show you what equipment you need. It's not expensive, in the slightest bit.
