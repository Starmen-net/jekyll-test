Digital music production, has really changed how musicians, both professional and ameatur, record music. It's flexable, and some applications, like Apple's Garageband, have really brought a professional sounding, but easy to use for the home user.

In this tutorial, I'll show you what equipment you need. It's not expensive, in the slightest bit.
