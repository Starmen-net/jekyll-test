{% include box-open.html box-id="789" title="Submission Rules:" author-id="926" timestamp="2005-04-03 00:11:37 +0600" type="norm" dbname="box58093" last-modified-by="127" %}
<ul>
<li>Your song or poem represents you and your poetic or musical ability. Spend some time making it sound nice. Don't just send something in for the sake of having your name up. Put some effort into it!</li>
<li>It must be EarthBound related. This whole site is about EarthBound, so your poem or song should be, too.</li>
<li>Write it with an audience in mind. If your poem were a game, it should be rated E for everyone. (No excessive violence or sex.)</li>
<li>Don't copy a poem, change a word or two, and call it your own. Write your own. Be original!</li>
<li>The minimum submission is a three line haiku, but you can easily do more than that.</li>
<li>If you send a sound file along with your work, acceptable formats include .wav, .ra, and .mp3 (preferably zipped). If you do send a sound file, please try to keep it under 3MB.</li>
<li>If your poem or song is about a staff member, an #earthbound op, a forum member, or just anyone who visits the site in general, you must get their permission before writing anything about them. I'll be checking with the person if I get such a poem or song.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Be sure to title your poem. "Untitled 7" may sound like a good title for an avant-garde art piece, but we want to see your work with a title that has something to do with your poem or song.</li>
<li>You can include your poem in: .doc, .html, or .txt format, but probably the easiest for you and me is to just include your work in the body of the e-mail.</li>
<li>Also, include the name under which you want the poem to be posted under. Don't assume I know who it's from, because I don't.</li>
</ul>

Thanks to Frodis for laying out these rules, and leaving the guidelines in the FTP.
