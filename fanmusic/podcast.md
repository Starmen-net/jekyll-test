Many of you might remember, that I had a short stint being a Radio PSI Podcaster. I was greeted with staunch opposition to the format that I had decided to use, which was the iPod Podcasting enhanced .mp4 format. 
<p />
I axed the project after only three editions, I didn't really think it fit the site. After all, we have great archives of live Radio PSI programming. 
<p />
I did enjoy making the podcasts, and I didn't want to abandon the idea of podcasts. So, I decided to reinvent the idea. I decided to focus on making a podcast that contains only fan-submitted material!
<p />
It's the podcast Starmen.net should have! I plan on making the first editions of this podcast (in the MP3 format) available in the first quarter of 2007.
<p />
Keep submitting to Fan Music, 
<p />
